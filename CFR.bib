	abstract = {Climate field reconstructions (CFRs) combine modern observational data with paleoclimatic proxies to estimate climate variables over spatiotemporal grids during time periods when widespread observations of climatic conditions do not exist. The Common Era (CE) has been a period over which many seasonally- and annually-resolved CFRs have been produced on regional to global scales. CFRs over the CE were first produced in the 1970s using dendroclimatic records and linear regression-based approaches. Since that time, many new CFRs have been produced using a wide range of proxy data sets and reconstruction techniques. We assess the early history of research on CFRs for the CE, which provides context for our review of advances in CFR research over the last two decades. We review efforts to derive gridded hydroclimatic CFRs over continental regions using networks of tree-ring proxies. We subsequently explore work to produce hemispheric- and global-scale CFRs of surface temperature using multi-proxy data sets, before specifically reviewing recently-developed data assimilation techniques and how they have been used to produce simultaneous reconstructions of multiple climatic fields globally. We then review efforts to develop standardized and digitized databases of proxy networks for use in CFR research, before concluding with some thoughts on important next steps for CFR development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The climate of the past millennium provides a baseline for understanding the background of natural climate variability upon which current anthropogenic changes are superimposed. As this period also contains high data density from proxy sources (e.g., ice cores, stalagmites, corals, tree rings, and sediments), it provides a unique opportunity for understanding both global and regional-scale climate responses to natural forcing. Toward that end, an ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) for the period 850–2005 (the CESM Last Millennium Ensemble, or CESM-LME) is now available to the community. This ensemble includes simulations forced with the transient evolution of solar intensity, volcanic emissions, greenhouse gases, aerosols, land-use conditions, and orbital parameters, both together and individually. The CESM-LME thus allows for evaluation of the relative contributions of external forcing and internal variability to changes evident in the paleoclimate data record, as well as providing a longer-term perspective for understanding events in the modern instrumental period. It also constitutes a dynamically consistent framework within which to diagnose mechanisms of regional variability. Results demonstrate an important influence of internal variability on regional responses of the climate system during the past millennium. All the forcings, particularly large volcanic eruptions, are found to be regionally influential during the preindustrial period, while anthropogenic greenhouse gas and aerosol changes dominate the forced variability of the mid- to late twentieth century.},

	abstract = {An overview of a simulation referred to as the ‘‘Last Millennium’’ (LM) simulation of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), is presented. The CCSM4 LM simulation reproduces many largescale climate patterns suggested by historical and proxy-data records, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface temperatures cooling to the early 1800s Common Era by ;0.58C (NH) and ;0.38C (SH), followed by warming to the present. High latitudes of both hemispheres show polar ampliﬁcation of the cooling from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) associated with sea ice increases. The LM simulation does not reproduce La Nin˜ a–like cooling in the eastern Paciﬁc Ocean during the MCA relative to the LIA, as has been suggested by proxy reconstructions. Still, dry medieval conditions over the southwestern and central United States are simulated in agreement with proxy indicators for these regions. Strong global cooling is associated with large volcanic eruptions, with indications of multidecadal colder climate in response to larger eruptions. The CCSM4’s response to large volcanic eruptions captures some reconstructed patterns of temperature changes over Europe and North America, but not those of precipitation in the Asian monsoon region. The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has higher variance at centennial periods in the LM simulation compared to the 1850 nontransient run, suggesting a long-term Atlantic Ocean response to natural forcings. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Paciﬁc decadal oscillation (PDO), and El Nin˜ o–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability modes show little or no change. CCSM4 does not simulate a persistent positive NAO or a prolonged period of negative PDO during the MCA, as suggested by some proxy reconstructions.},

            The American West exemplifies drought-sensitive regions with growing populations. Paleoclimate investigations have documented severe droughts in this region before European settling, with major implications for water management and planning. Here, we leverage paleoclimate data assimilation to reconstruct past climate states, enabling a large-scale multivariate investigation of U.S. drought dynamics over the last millennium. These results confirm that La Niña conditions significantly influence southwest U.S. drought over the past millennium but only account for, by one metric, {\textasciitilde}13\% of interannual drought variability in that region. Atlantic sea surface temperatures may also contribute a small influence, but unexplained variability suggests a substantial role for internal atmospheric variability. This conclusion is buttressed by analysis of simulations from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble. While greenhouse gases will increase future drought risk, as shown in other work, interannual U.S. drought variations will also be widely influenced by processes internal to the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The injection of sulfur into the stratosphere by explosive volcanic eruptions is the cause of signiﬁcant climate variability. Based on sulfate records from a suite of ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica, the eVolv2k database includes estimates of the magnitudes and approximate source latitudes of major volcanic stratospheric sulfur injection (VSSI) events from 500 BCE to 1900 CE, constituting an update of prior reconstructions and an extension of the record by 1000 years. The database incorporates improvements to the ice core records (in terms of synchronisation and dating) and reﬁnements to the methods used to estimate VSSI from ice core records, and it includes ﬁrst estimates of the random uncertainties in VSSI values. VSSI estimates for many of the largest eruptions, including Samalas (1257), Tambora (1815), and Laki (1783), are within 10 \% of prior estimates. A number of strong events are included in eVolv2k which are largely underestimated or not included in earlier VSSI reconstructions, including events in 540, 574, 682, and 1108 CE. The long-term annual mean VSSI from major volcanic eruptions is estimated to be ∼ 0.5 Tg [S] yr−1, ∼ 50 \% greater than a prior reconstruction due to the identiﬁcation of more events and an increase in the magnitude of many intermediate events. A long-term latitudinally and monthly resolved stratospheric aerosol optical depth (SAOD) time series is reconstructed from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates, and the resulting global mean SAOD is found to be similar (within 33 \%) to a prior reconstruction for most of the largest eruptions. The long-term (500 BCE–1900 CE) average global mean SAOD estimated from the eVolv2k VSSI estimates including a constant “background” injection of stratospheric sulfur is ∼ 0.014, 30 \% greater than a prior reconstruction. These new long-term reconstructions of past VSSI and SAOD variability give context to recent volcanic forcing, suggesting that the 20th century was a period of somewhat weaker than average volcanic forcing, with current best estimates of 20th century mean VSSI and SAOD values being 25 and 14 \% less, respectively, than the mean of the 500 BCE to 1900 CE period.

Conversely, when data are relatively plentiful and accurate, the estimate tracks the target closely, at least when considering the hemispheric mean. However, in this case, our prior ensemble size of 10 000 appears to be inadequate to correctly represent the true posterior, and the regional performance is poor. Using correlations to assess performance gives a more encouraging picture, with signiﬁcant correlations ranging from about 0.3 when data are sparse to values over 0.7 when data are plentiful, but the residual RMS errors are substantial in all cases. Our results imply that caution is required in interpreting climate reconstructions, especially when considering the regional scale, as skill on this basis is markedly lower than on the large scale of hemispheric mean temperature.},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate proxy data span seasonal to millennial timescales, and Earth’s climate system has both highand low-frequency components. Yet it is currently unclear how best to incorporate multiple timescales of proxy data into a single reconstruction framework and to also capture both high- and low-frequency components of reconstructed variables. Here we present a data assimilation approach that can explicitly incorporate proxy data at arbitrary timescales. The principal advantage of using such an approach is that it allows much more proxy data to inform a climate reconstruction, though there can be additional beneﬁts. Through a series of ofﬂine data-assimilation-based pseudoproxy experiments, we ﬁnd that atmosphere–ocean states are most skillfully reconstructed by incorporating proxies across multiple timescales compared to using proxies at short (annual) or long ( ∼ decadal) timescales alone. Additionally, reconstructions that incorporate long-timescale pseudoproxies improve the low-frequency components of the reconstructions relative to using only high-resolution pseudoproxies. We argue that this is because time averaging high-resolution observations improves their covariance relationship with the slowly varying components of the coupled-climate system, which the data assimilation algorithm can exploit. These results are consistent across the climate models considered, despite the model variables having very different spectral characteristics. Our results also suggest that it may be possible to reconstruct features of the oceanic meridional overturning circulation based on atmospheric surface temperature proxies, though here we ﬁnd such reconstructions lack spectral power over a broad range of frequencies.},

Traditionally, instrumental or climate model statistical relationships are used to spread information from proxy measurements to other locations and to other climate variables. Here ensembles drawn from single climate models and from combinations of multiple climate models are used to reconstruct temperature variability over the last millennium in idealized experiments. We find that reconstructions derived from multi-model ensembles produce lower error than reconstructions from single-model ensembles when reconstructing independent model and instrumental data. Specifically, we find the largest decreases in error over regions far from proxy locations that are often associated with large uncertainties in model physics, such as mid- and high-latitude ocean and sea-ice regions. Furthermore, we find that multi-model ensemble reconstructions outperform singlemodel reconstructions that use covariance localization. We propose that multi-model ensembles could be used to improve paleoclimate reconstructions in time periods beyond the last millennium and for climate variables other than air temperature, such as drought metrics or sea ice variables.},

In general, the applied modifications resulted in enhanced reconstruction skill compared to version 1, especially in precipitation, sea-­level pressure and other variables beside the mostly assimilated temperature data, which already had high quality in the previous version.

In ensemble-based approaches, the background-error covariance matrix can be estimated from the ensemble. Due to the usually limited ensemble size, the background-error covariance matrix is subject to the so-called sampling error. We test different methods to reduce the effect of sampling error in a published paleoclimate data assimilation setup. For this purpose, we conduct a set of experiments, where we assimilate early instrumental data and proxy records stored in trees, to investigate the effect of (1) the applied localization function and localization length scale; (2) multiplicative and additive inﬂation techniques; (3) temporal localization of monthly data, which applies if several time steps are estimated together in the same assimilation window. We ﬁnd that the estimation of the background-error covariance matrix can be improved by additive inﬂation where the background-error covariance matrix is not only calculated from the sample covariance but blended with a climatological covariance matrix. Implementing a temporal localization for monthly resolved data also led to a better reconstruction.},

Different sources of information, from proxy records and documentary data to instrumental measurements, were assimilated in previous studies to reconstruct past climate fields. However, precipitation reconstructions are often based on indirect sources (e.g., proxy records). Assimilating precipitation measurements is a challenging task because they have high uncertainties, often represent only a small region, and generally do not follow a Gaussian distribution. In this paper, experiments are conducted to test the possibility of using information about precipitation in climate reconstruction with monthly resolution by assimilating monthly instrumental precipitation amounts or the number of wet days per month, solely or in addition to other climate variables such as temperature and sea-level pressure, into an ensemble of climate model simulations. The skill of all variables (temperature, precipitation, sea-level pressure) improved over the pure model simulations when only monthly precipitation amounts were assimilated.
Assimilating the number of wet days resulted in similar or better skill compared to assimilating the precipitation amount. The experiments with different types of instrumental observations being assimilated indicate that precipitation data can be useful, particularly if no other variable is available from a given region.
Overall the experiments show promising results because with the assimilation of precipitation information a new data source can be exploited for climate reconstructions. The wet day records can become an especially important data source in future climate reconstructions because many existing records date several centuries back in time and are not limited by the availability of meteorological instruments.},

Although δ18O has been primarily interpreted as a proxy for local air temperature, isotope-enabled climate models have established that there are many nonlocal and nontemperature-related climatic inﬂuences on isotopic signals at coring locations. Moreover, recent observational studies have linked ice core isotopes to nonlocal patterns of climate variability, particularly to midlatitude atmospheric circulation patterns and to variations in tropical climate. Therefore, paleoclimate reconstructions may better utilize ice core isotope proxies by combining them with isotope-enabled climate models. Here we employ a data assimilation-based technique that fuses isotopic proxy information with the dynamical constraints of climate models. Through several idealized and real proxy experiments we assess the spatial and temporal extent to which isotope records can reconstruct surface temperature, 500 hPa geopotential height, and precipitation. We ﬁnd local reconstruction skill to be most robust across the reconstructions, particularly for temperature and geopotential height, as well as limited nonlocal skill in the tropics. These results are in agreement with long-held views that isotopes in ice cores have clear value as local climate proxies, particularly for temperature and atmospheric circulation. These results also show that in principle nonlocal climate information may also be inferred from ice cores. However, the spatial range of this information is nonuniform and depends on skillful modeling of the proxy data within the reconstruction process.},

            Hydroclimate extremes critically affect human and natural systems, but there remain many unanswered questions about their causes and how to interpret their dynamics in the past and in climate change projections. These uncertainties are due, in part, to the lack of long-term, spatially resolved hydroclimate reconstructions and information on the underlying physical drivers for many regions. Here we present the first global reconstructions of hydroclimate and associated climate dynamical variables over the past two thousand years. We use a data assimilation approach tailored to reconstruct hydroclimate that optimally combines 2,978 paleoclimate proxy-data time series with the physical constraints of an atmosphere—ocean climate model. The global reconstructions are annually or seasonally resolved and include two spatiotemporal drought indices, near-surface air temperature, an index of North Atlantic variability, the location of the intertropical convergence zone, and monthly Niño indices. This database, called the Paleo Hydrodynamics Data Assimilation product (PHYDA), will provide a critical new platform for investigating the causes of past climate variability and extremes, while informing interpretations of future hydroclimate projections.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Because of the relatively brief observational record, the climate dynamics that drive multiyear to centennial hydroclimate variability are not adequately characterized and understood. Paleoclimate reconstructions based on data assimilation (DA) optimally fuse paleoclimate proxies with the dynamical constraints of climate models, thus providing a coherent dynamical picture of the past. DA is therefore an important new tool for elucidating the mechanisms of hydroclimate variability over the last several millennia. But DA has so far remained untested for global hydroclimate reconstructions. Here we explore whether or not DA can be used to skillfully reconstruct global hydroclimate variability along with the driving climate dynamics. Through a set of idealized pseudoproxy experiments, we find that an established DA reconstruction approach can in principle be used to reconstruct hydroclimate at both annual and seasonal timescales. We find that the skill of such reconstructions is generally highest near the proxy sites. This set of reconstruction experiments is specifically designed to estimate a realistic upper bound for the skill of this DA approach. Importantly, this experimental framework allows us to see where and for what variables the reconstruction approach may never achieve high skill. In particular for tree rings, we find that hydroclimate reconstructions depend critically on moisture-sensitive trees, while temperature reconstructions depend critically on temperature-sensitive trees. Real-world DA-based reconstructions will therefore likely require a spatial mixture of temperature- and moisture-sensitive trees to reconstruct both temperature and hydroclimate variables. Additionally, we illustrate how DA can be used to elucidate the dynamical mechanisms of drought with two examples: tropical drivers of multiyear droughts in the North American Southwest and in equatorial East Africa. This work thus provides a foundation for future DA-based hydroclimate reconstructions using real-proxy networks while also highlighting the utility of this important tool for hydroclimate research.},

A minimalistic, computationally inexpensive DA technique is employed that requires only a static ensemble of climatologically plausible states. Pseudoproxy experiments are performed with both general circulation model (GCM) and Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) data by reconstructing surface temperature ﬁelds from a sparse network of noisy pseudoproxies. The DA approach is compared to a conventional CFR approach based on principal component analysis (PCA) for experiments on global domains. DA outperforms PCA in reconstructing global-mean temperature in all experiments and is more consistent across experiments, with a range of time series correlations of 0.69–0.94 compared to 0.19–0.87 for the PCA method. DA improvements are even more evident in spatial reconstruction skill, especially in sparsely sampled pseudoproxy regions and for 20CR experiments. It is hypothesized that DA improves spatial reconstructions because it relies on coherent, spatially local temperature patterns, which remain robust even when glacial states are used to reconstruct nonglacial states and vice versa. These local relationships, as utilized by DA, appear to be more robust than the orthogonal patterns of variability utilized by PCA. Comparing results for GCM and 20CR data indicates that pseudoproxy experiments that rely solely on GCM data may give a false impression of reconstruction skill.},

            Climatic variations at decadal scales such as phases of accelerated warming or weak monsoons have profound effects on society and economy. Studying these variations requires insights from the past. However, most current reconstructions provide either time series or fields of regional surface climate, which limit our understanding of the underlying dynamics. Here, we present the first monthly paleo-reanalysis covering the period 1600 to 2005. Over land, instrumental temperature and surface pressure observations, temperature indices derived from historical documents and climate sensitive tree-ring measurements were assimilated into an atmospheric general circulation model ensemble using a Kalman filtering technique. This data set combines the advantage of traditional reconstruction methods of being as close as possible to observations with the advantage of climate models of being physically consistent and having 3-dimensional information about the state of the atmosphere for various variables and at all points in time. In contrast to most statistical reconstructions, centennial variability stems from the climate model and its forcings, no stationarity assumptions are made and error estimates are provided.},

Here we consider effects arising when (1) the time interval over which the data average and the climate interval of interest have different durations, (2) those intervals are offset from one another in time (including when those offsets are unknown due to chronological uncertainty), and (3) the paleoclimate archive has been smoothed in time prior to sampling. Because all proxy measurements are time averages of one sort or another and it is challenging to tailor proxy measurements to precise time intervals, such errors are expected to be common in model–data and data–data comparisons, but how large and prevalent they are is unclear. This work provides a 1st-order quantiﬁcation of temporal representativity errors and studies the interacting effects of sampling procedures, archive smoothing, chronological offsets and errors (e.g., arising from radiocarbon dating), and the spectral character of the climate process being sampled.},

Previous studies have identified disagreements between paleoclimate reconstructions and climate model simulations with respect to the magnitude and recovery from volcanic cooling, questioning the fidelity of climate model simulations, reconstructions, or both. Using the paleoenvironmental data assimilation framework of the Last Millennium Reanalysis, this study investigates the causes of the disagreements, using both real and simulated data. We demonstrate that discrepancies since 1600 CE can be largely resolved by assimilating tree-ring density records only, targeting growing season temperature instead of annual temperature, and performing the comparison at proxy locales.

	abstract = {Abstract. The Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR) utilizes an ensemble methodology to assimilate paleoclimate data for the production of annually resolved climate field reconstructions of the Common Era. Two key elements are the focus of this work: the set of assimilated proxy records and the forward models that map climate variables to proxy measurements. Results based on an updated proxy database and seasonal regression-based forward models are compared to the LMR prototype, which was based on a smaller set of proxy records and simpler proxy models formulated as univariate linear regressions against annual temperature. Validation against various instrumental-era gridded analyses shows that the new reconstructions of surface air temperature and 500 hPa geopotential height are significantly improved (from 10 \% to more than 100 \%), while improvements in reconstruction of the Palmer Drought Severity Index are more modest. Additional experiments designed to isolate the sources of improvement reveal the importance of the updated proxy records, including coral records for improving tropical reconstructions, and tree-ring density records for temperature reconstructions, particularly in high northern latitudes. Proxy forward models that account for seasonal responses, and dependence on both temperature and moisture for tree-ring width, also contribute to improvements in reconstructed thermodynamic and hydroclimate variables in midlatitudes. The variability of temperature at multidecadal to centennial scales is also shown to be sensitive to the set of assimilated proxies, especially to the inclusion of primarily moisture-sensitive tree-ring-width records.},

Results for a sparse network of 100 idealized observations for a quasi-geostrophic model of a jet interacting with a mountain reveal that, for a wide range of observation averaging times, analysis errors are reduced by about 50\% relative to the control case without assimilation. Results are robust to changes to observational error, the number of observations, and an imperfect model. Speciﬁcally, analysis errors are reduced relative to the control case for observations having errors up to three times the climatological variance for a ﬁxed 100-station network, and for networks consisting of ten or more stations when observational errors are ﬁxed at one-third the climatological variance. In the limit of small numbers of observations, station location becomes critically important, motivating an optimally determined network. A network of ﬁfteen optimally determined observations reduces analysis errors by 30\% relative to the control, as compared to 50\% for a randomly chosen network of 100 observations.},

	abstract = {An “oﬄine” approach to DA is used, where static ensemble samples are drawn from existing CMIP climate-model simulations to serve as the prior estimate of climate variables. We use linear, univariate forward models (“proxy system models (PSMs)”) that map climate variables to proxy measurements by ﬁtting proxy data to 2 m air temperature from gridded instrumental temperature data; the linear PSMs are then used to predict proxy values from the prior estimate. Results for the LMR are compared against six gridded instrumental temperature data sets and 25\% of the proxy records are withheld from assimilation for independent veriﬁcation. Results show broad agreement with previous reconstructions of Northern Hemisphere mean 2 m air temperature, with millennial-scale cooling, a multicentennial warm period around 1000 C.E., and a cold period coincident with the Little Ice Age (circa 1450–1800 C.E.). Veriﬁcation against gridded instrumental data sets during 1880–2000 C.E. reveals greatest skill in the tropics and lowest skill over Northern Hemisphere land areas. Veriﬁcation against independent proxy records indicates substantial improvement relative to the model (prior) data without proxy assimilation. As an illustrative example, we present multivariate reconstructed ﬁelds for a singular event, the 1808/1809 “mystery” volcanic eruption, which reveal global cooling that is strongly enhanced locally due to the presence of the Paciﬁc-North America wave pattern in the 500 hPa geopotential height ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate reconstruction relies on estimates of spatiotemporal relationships among climate quantities to interpolate between proxy data. This work quantiﬁes how structural uncertainties in those relationships translate to uncertainties in reconstructions of past climate. We develop and apply a data assimilation uncertainty quantiﬁcation approach to paleoclimate networks and observational uncertainties representative of data for the last millennium. We ﬁnd that structural uncertainties arising from uncertain spatial covariance relationships typically contribute 10\% of the total uncertainty in reconstructed temperature variability at small (∼200 km), continental, and hemispheric length scales, with larger errors (50\% or larger) in regions where long‐range climate covariances are least certain. These structural uncertainties contribute far more to errors in uncertainty quantiﬁcation, sometimes by a factor of 5 or higher. Accounting for and reducing uncertainties in climate model dynamics and resulting covariance relationships will improve paleoclimate reconstruction accuracy. Plain Language Summary Reconstructing past climate conditions is important to characterize climate variability and extremes, with implications for understanding future variability and change. An important source of information is data from proxy sources like tree rings, ice cores, ocean sediment cores, and other sources, but those data are not available everywhere on the globe. Extracting climate information from these data requires information about how climate properties covary in space and time, and that information is inevitably ﬂawed because we lack a complete picture of how the climate behaves. This work seeks to address how much those ﬂaws matter, how they propagate to reconstructions of past climate, and how we can reduce them. We use different physically plausible representations of climate physics from three different coupled climate models in a series of reconstruction experiments and suggest that uncertain physics typically accounts for 10\% of reconstruction errors in the particular case of reconstructing surface air temperature over the Last Millennium, with regionally higher values (50\% or larger). We can reduce these errors by improving climate models and by improving how we represent uncertain physics in climate reconstructions.},

The latter is consistent with anomalous southward energy transport mediated by the atmosphere. Net downward shortwave radiation increases at both the top of the atmosphere and the surface, indicating a decrease in planetary albedo, likely due to a decrease in low clouds. Heat is absorbed by the climate system and the oceans warm. Wavelet analysis of the AMO time series shows a reddening of the frequency spectrum on the 50to 100-year timescale, but no evidence of a distinct multidecadal or centennial spectral peak. This latter result is insensitive to both the choice of prior model and the calibration dataset used in the data assimilation algorithm, suggesting that the lack of a distinct multidecadal spectral peak is a robust result.},

	doi = {10.5194/cp-15-661-2019},
	abstract = {Abstract. The Antarctic temperature changes over the past millennia remain more
uncertain than in many other continental regions. This has several origins:
(1) the number of high-resolution ice cores is small, in particular on the
East Antarctic plateau and in some coastal areas in East Antarctica; (2) the
short and spatially sparse instrumental records limit the calibration period
for reconstructions and the assessment of the methodologies; (3) the link
between isotope records from ice cores and local climate is usually complex
and dependent on the spatial scales and timescales investigated. Here, we use
climate model results, pseudoproxy experiments and data assimilation
experiments to assess the potential for
reconstructing the Antarctic temperature over the last 2 millennia based on a
new database of stable oxygen isotopes in ice cores compiled in the framework
of Antarctica2k (Stenni et al., 2017). The well-known covariance between
δ18O and temperature is reproduced in the two isotope-enabled
models used (ECHAM5/MPI-OM and ECHAM5-wiso), but is generally weak over the
different Antarctic regions, limiting the skill of the reconstructions.
Furthermore, the strength of the link displays large variations over the past
millennium, further affecting the potential skill of temperature
reconstructions based on statistical methods which rely on the assumption
that the last decades are a good estimate for longer temperature
reconstructions. Using a data assimilation technique allows, in theory, for
changes in the δ18O–temperature link through time and space
to be taken into account. Pseudoproxy experiments confirm the benefits of
using data assimilation methods instead of statistical methods that provide
reconstructions with unrealistic variances in some Antarctic subregions. They
also confirm that the relatively weak link between both variables leads to a
limited potential for reconstructing temperature based on
δ18O. However, the reconstruction skill is higher and more
uniform among reconstruction methods when the reconstruction target is the
Antarctic as a whole rather than smaller Antarctic subregions. This
consistency between the methods at the large scale is also observed when
reconstructing temperature based on the real δ18O regional
composites of Stenni et al. (2017). In this case, temperature reconstructions
based on data assimilation confirm the long-term cooling over Antarctica
during the last millennium, and the later onset of anthropogenic warming
compared with the simulations without data assimilation, which is especially
visible in West Antarctica. Data assimilation also allows for models and
direct observations to be reconciled by reproducing the east–west contrast
in the recent temperature trends. This recent warming pattern is likely
mostly driven by internal variability given the large spread of individual
Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP)/Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP) model realizations in simulating it. As in the
pseudoproxy framework, the reconstruction methods perform differently at the
subregional scale, especially in terms of the variance of the time series
produced. While the potential benefits of using a data assimilation method
instead of a statistical method have been highlighted in a pseudoproxy
framework, the instrumental series are too short to confirm this in a
realistic setup.},

Second, by varying the external forcing, the parameters of the data assimilation method, and the parameters controlling the equilibrium climate sensitivity of the climate model, we demonstrate that the uncertainty in model results is much lower in simulations using data assimilation than in those without it. This observation implies that the data assimilation, using a set of 56 proxies, is providing an efficient and robust constraint on the simulated climate variability over the past centuries. At the hemispheric and continental scales, the model reconstructions using data assimilation are in good agreement with both the instrumental record of the past 150 years and reconstructions of climate in past centuries derived from the application of traditional statistical approaches to networks of proxy data. This increases the confidence in both the data assimilation and traditional statistical approaches. Our data assimilation method, however, is unable to provide a reliable reconstruction over the North Atlantic Ocean, which we attribute to the paucity of proxy data in that region.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Improving our knowledge of the temporal and spatial variability of the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) surface mass balance (SMB) is crucial to reduce the uncertainties of past, present, and future Antarctic contributions to sea level rise. An examination of the surface air temperature–SMB relationship in model simulations demonstrates a strong link between the two. Reconstructions based on ice cores display a weaker relationship, indicating a model–data discrepancy that may be due to model biases or to the non-climatic noise present in the records. We find that, on the regional scale, the modeled relationship between surface air temperature and SMB is often stronger than between temperature and δ18O. This suggests that SMB data can be used to reconstruct past surface air temperature. Using this finding, we assimilate isotope-enabled SMB and δ18O model output with ice core observations to generate a new surface air temperature reconstruction. Although an independent evaluation of the skill is difficult because of the short observational time series, this new reconstruction outperforms the previous reconstructions for the continental-mean temperature that were based on δ18O alone. The improvement is most significant for the East Antarctic region, where the uncertainties are particularly large. Finally, using the same data assimilation method as for the surface air temperature reconstruction, we provide a spatial SMB reconstruction for the AIS over the last 2 centuries, showing large variability in SMB trends at a regional scale, with an increase (0.82 Gt yr−2) in West Antarctica over 1957–2000 and a decrease in East Antarctica during the same period (−0.13 Gt yr−2). As expected, this is consistent with the recent reconstruction used as a constraint in the data assimilation.},

For a given number of minimization steps, this approach yields larger costfunction reductions than the sensitivity calculation using only analysis perturbations. Nonlinear forecasts using only one type of perturbation conﬁrm an improved performance in the case of tendency perturbations.

              The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the global climate system. Recent studies suggested a twentieth‐century weakening of the AMOC of unprecedented amplitude ({\textasciitilde}15\%) over the last millennium. Here we present a record of δ

            Plain Language Summary
            Oceanic circulation in the North Atlantic transports huge amounts of water, heat, salt, carbon, and nutrients around the globe. As such, changes in the strength of oceanic currents can yield profound changes in both North American and European climate, in addition to affecting the African and Indian summer monsoon rainfall. In this study, we used geochemical evidence to highlight a slowdown in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation over the last century. This change appears to be unique over the last 1,500 years and could be related to global warming and freshwater input from ice sheet melt. Based on our data, we also suggest that the period often called “The Little Ice Age” was characterized by a slowdown, of less amplitude than the modern weakening, in the North Atlantic Ocean circulation. Thus, our results contribute to ongoing investigations of the state of the circulation in the North Atlantic by providing a robust reconstruction of its variability over the last 1,500 years.

	abstract = {Significance
            Climate models are foundational to formulations of climate policy and must successfully reproduce key features of the climate system. The temporal spectrum of observed global surface temperature is one such critical benchmark. This spectrum is known to obey scaling laws connecting astronomical forcings, from orbital to annual scales. We provide evidence that the current hierarchy of climate models is capable of reproducing the increase in variance in global-mean temperature at low frequencies. We suggest that successful climate predictions at decadal-to-centennial horizons hinge critically on the accuracy of initial and boundary conditions, particularly for the deep ocean state.
          , 
            Climate records exhibit scaling behavior with large exponents, resulting in larger fluctuations at longer timescales. It is unclear whether climate models are capable of simulating these fluctuations, which draws into question their ability to simulate such variability in the coming decades and centuries. Using the latest simulations and data syntheses, we find agreement for spectra derived from observations and models on timescales ranging from interannual to multimillennial. Our results confirm the existence of a scaling break between orbital and annual peaks, occurring around millennial periodicities. That both simple and comprehensive ocean–atmosphere models can reproduce these features suggests that long-range persistence is a consequence of the oceanic integration of both gradual and abrupt climate forcings. This result implies that Holocene low-frequency variability is partly a consequence of the climate system’s integrated memory of orbital forcing. We conclude that climate models appear to contain the essential physics to correctly simulate the spectral continuum of global-mean temperature; however, regional discrepancies remain unresolved. A critical element of successfully simulating suborbital climate variability involves, we hypothesize, initial conditions of the deep ocean state that are consistent with observations of the recent past.},

Several recent studies have foregone climate model forecasts during assimilation due to the computational expense of running coupled global climate models (CGCMs) and the relatively low skill of these forecasts on longer timescales. Here we greatly diminish the computational cost by employing an empirical forecast model (linear inverse model, LIM), which has been shown to have skill comparable to CGCMs for forecasting annual-to-decadal surface temperature anomalies. We reconstruct annual-average 2 m air temperature over the instrumental period (1850–2000) using proxy records from the PAGES 2k Consortium Phase 1 database; proxy models for estimating proxy observations are calibrated on GISTEMP surface temperature analyses. We compare results for LIMs calibrated using observational (Berkeley Earth), reanalysis (20th Century Reanalysis), and CMIP5 climate model (CCSM4 and MPI) data relative to a control offline reconstruction method. Generally, we find that the usage of LIM forecasts for online PDA increases reconstruction agreement with the instrumental record for both spatial fields and global mean temperature (GMT). Specifically, the coefficient of efficiency (CE) skill metric for detrended GMT increases by an average of 57 \% over the offline benchmark. LIM experiments display a common pattern of skill improvement in the spatial fields over Northern Hemisphere land areas and in the high-latitude North Atlantic–Barents Sea corridor. Experiments for non-CGCM-calibrated LIMs reveal region-specific reductions in spatial skill compared to the offline control, likely due to aspects of the LIM calibration process. Overall, the CGCM-calibrated LIMs have the best performance when considering both spatial fields and GMT. A comparison with the persistence forecast experiment suggests that improvements are associated with the linear dynamical constraints of the forecast and not simply persistence of temperature anomalies.},

Due to high computational cost and relatively low forecast skill, most reconstruction experiments omit the prediction step, where a forecast is made from the previously reconstructed state to the next time proxy data is available. In order to enable this critical aspect of PDA, we propose an efficient method of generating forecast ensembles of coupled climate fields using a linear inverse model (LIM). We describe the general calibration of a LIM on multiple fields using a two-step empirical orthogonal function field compression to efficiently represent the state. We find that a LIM calibrated on global climate model (GCM) data yields skillful forecasts, including for out-of-sample tests on data from a different GCM. The deterministic forecast skill tests for scalar indices show that the LIM outperforms damped persistence at leads up to 3 years and has skill up to 10 years for global average sea surface temperature. Analysis of 1-year forecasts reveals that the LIM captures dynamic climate features with local and remote predictability related to teleconnections. The forecast ensemble characteristics of the LIM, which in part determine the weighting of information for PDA experiments, show that the LIM generally produces ensemble forecast errors that are 10\% to 70\% larger than ensemble variance for 1-year forecasts on data representative of the last millennium. These results show that the LIM produces ensembles with reasonable calibration but also that LIMs for PDA may require some variance tuning to work optimally for data assimilation experiments.},

Instrumental validation of reconstructed seasurface temperature and 0–700 m ocean heat content shows broad regions of positive spatial correlations, and high correlations (∼0.6–0.9) for global averages and indices of large-scale modes of atmospheric variability. Compared to previous reconstructions, the online reconstructions show global and hemispheric averages with little-to-no millennial-scale trend and global-mean temperatures ∼0.25–0.5 K cooler during early periods (1000–1400 C.E.). The spatial anomaly differences of average temperature between an early (1000–1250 C.E.) and later (1400–1700 C.E.) period show warm anomalies over highlatitude Europe and cool tropical conditions in partial agreement with previous assessments. The addition of online data assimilation, which provides dynamical memory to climate proxy information, is shown to be crucial for adequately characterizing decadal-to-centennial-scale variability of 0–700 m ocean heat content.

	abstract = {Abstract. Water availability is fundamental to societies and ecosystems, but our understanding of variations in hydroclimate (including extreme events, flooding, and decadal periods of drought) is limited because of a paucity of modern instrumental observations that are distributed unevenly across the globe and only span parts of the 20th and 21st centuries. Such data coverage is insufficient for characterizing hydroclimate and its associated dynamics because of its multidecadal to centennial variability and highly regionalized spatial signature. High-resolution (seasonal to decadal) hydroclimatic proxies that span all or parts of the Common Era (CE) and paleoclimate simulations from climate models are therefore important tools for augmenting our understanding of hydroclimate variability. In particular, the comparison of the two sources of information is critical for addressing the uncertainties and limitations of both while enriching each of their interpretations. We review the principal proxy data available for hydroclimatic reconstructions over the CE and highlight the contemporary understanding of how these proxies are interpreted as hydroclimate indicators. We also review the available last-millennium simulations from fully coupled climate models and discuss several outstanding challenges associated with simulating hydroclimate variability and change over the CE. A specific review of simulated hydroclimatic changes forced by volcanic events is provided, as is a discussion of expected improvements in estimated radiative forcings, models, and their implementation in the future. Our review of hydroclimatic proxies and last-millennium model simulations is used as the basis for articulating a variety of considerations and best practices for how to perform proxy–model comparisons of CE hydroclimate. This discussion provides a framework for how best to evaluate hydroclimate variability and its associated dynamics using these comparisons and how they can better inform interpretations of both proxy data and model simulations. We subsequently explore means of using proxy–model comparisons to better constrain and characterize future hydroclimate risks. This is explored specifically in the context of several examples that demonstrate how proxy–model comparisons can be used to quantitatively constrain future hydroclimatic risks as estimated from climate model projections.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) has been applied to estimate the time-mean state, such as annual mean surface temperature for paleoclimate reconstruction. There are two types of DA for this purpose: online-DA and offline-DA. The online-DA estimates both time-mean states (analyses) and initial conditions for subsequent DA cycles, while the offline-DA only estimates the time-mean analyses. If there is sufficiently long predictability in the system of interest compared to the temporal resolution of the observations, online-DA is expected to outperform offline-DA by utilizing information in the initial conditions. However, previous studies failed to show the superiority of online-DA when time-averaged observations are assimilated, and the reason has not been investigated thoroughly. This study compares online-DA and offline-DA and investigates the relation to the predictability using an intermediate complexity general circulation model with perfect-model observing system simulation experiments. The result shows that the online-DA outperforms offline-DA when the length of predictability is longer than the averaging time of the observations. We also found that the longer the predictability, the more skillful the online-DA. Here, the ocean plays a crucial role in extending predictability, which helps online-DA to outperform offline-DA. Interestingly, the observations of near-surface air temperature over land are highly valuable to update the ocean variables in the analysis steps, suggesting the importance of using crossdomain covariance information between the atmosphere and the ocean when online-DA is applied to reconstruct paleoclimate.},

	abstract = {The oxygen isotopic composition of planktic foraminiferal calcite (𝛿18Oc) is one of the most prevalent proxies used in the paleoceanographic community. The relationship between 𝛿18Oc, temperature, and seawater oxygen isotopic composition (𝛿18Ow) is firmly rooted in thermodynamics, and experimental constraints are commonly used for sea surface temperature (SST) reconstructions. However, in marine sedimentary applications, additional sources of uncertainty emerge, and these uncertainty constraints have not as of yet been included in global calibration models. Here, we compile a global data set of over 2,600 marine sediment core top samples for five planktic species: Globigerinoides ruber, Trilobatus sacculifer, Globigerina bulloides, Neogloboquadrina incompta, and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma. We developed a suite of Bayesian regression models to calibrate the relationship between 𝛿18Oc and SST. Spanning SSTs from 0.0 to 29.5 ◦C, our annual model with species pooled together has a mean standard error of approximately 0.54‰. Accounting for seasonality and species-specific differences improves model validation, reducing the mean standard error to 0.47‰. Example applications spanning the Late Quaternary show good agreement with independent alkenone-based estimates. Our pooled calibration model may also be used for reconstruction in the deeper geological past, using modern planktic foraminifera as an analog for non-extant species. Our core top-based models provide a robust assessment of uncertainty in the 𝛿18Oc paleothermometer that can be used in statistical assessments of interproxy and model-proxy comparisons. The suite of models is publicly available as the Open Source software library bayfox, for Python, R, and MATLAB/Octave.},

Currently, however, it is unknown as to which TRW PSMs are optimal for practical PDA applications. This study proposes an artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN)‐based TRW PSM and compares its performance with those of existing TRW PSMs, including linear univariate model, linear multivariate model, and physically based VS‐Lite model. The results show that ANN‐based TRW PSM is more suitable for practical PDA applications than other three TRW PSMs in terms of performance and universality. Overall, the performances of the four TRW PSMs in PDA can be ranked as follows (from best to worst): ANN, linear multivariate model, linear univariate model, and physically based VS‐Lite model. In addition, the results of our study not only indicate that the ANN model is a really effective tool for constructing TRW PSM in practical PDA applications but also imply that the ANN model has the potential to provide new insights into the construction of other types of PSMs (e.g., speleothem δ18O PSM) when physics of the climate‐proxy relationships cannot be described fully in advance.},

	abstract = {Reconstructing past climate is beneficial for researchers to understand the mechanism of past climate change, recognize the context of modern climate change and predict scenarios of future climate change. Paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA), which was first introduced in 2000, is a promising approach and a significant issue in the context of past climate research. PDA has the same theoretical basis as the traditional data assimilation (DA) employed in the fields of atmosphere science, ocean science and land surface science. The main aim of PDA is to optimally estimate past climate states that are both consistent with the climate signal recorded in proxy and the dynamic understanding of the climate system through combining the physical laws and dynamic mechanisms of climate systems represented by climate models with climate signals recorded in proxies (e.g., tree rings, ice cores). After investigating the research status and latest advances of PDA abroad, in this paper, the background, concept and methodology of PAD are briefly introduced. Several special aspects and the development history of PAD are systematically summarized. The theoretical basis and typical cases associated with three frequently-used PAD methods (e.g., nudging, particle filter and ensemble square root filter) are analyzed and demonstrated. Finally, some underlying problems in current studies and key prospects in future research related to PDA are proposed to provide valuable thoughts on and a scientific basis for PDA research.},

Here we use a PSM of lake carbonate d18O to forward model pseudoproxy time-series for every terrestrial grid square in the SPEEDY-IER isotope enabled General Circulation Model (GCM), and compare the results with 31 records of lake d18O data from the Americas in the NOAA Paleoclimate Database. The model-data comparison shows general patterns of spatial variability in the lake d18O data are replicated by the combination of SPEEDY-IER and the PSM, with differences largely explained by known biases in the models. The results suggest improved spatial resolution/coverage of climate models and proxy data, respectively, is required for improved data-model comparison, as are increased numbers of higher temporal resolution proxy time series (sub decadal or better) and longer GCM runs. We prove the concept of data-model comparison using isotope enabled GCMs and lake isotope PSMs and outline potential avenues for further work.},

	abstract = {The spatiotemporal variations of the climate of the last millennium provide the context for understanding the recent climate. However, there are few 1000-year-long spatiotemporally continuous climate reconstructions at hemispheric to global scales. Here, a millennial, spatiotemporally continuous and annually resolved air temperature dataset for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) was reconstructed using paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) approach based on an expanded tree ring proxy dataset and artificial neural networkbased proxy system models. Verifications show the PDA-based reconstruction agrees well with instrumental temperature, previous proxy-based reconstructions and the Last Millennium Climate Reanalysis version 2 (LMRv2) dataset in space and time domains. Since the PDA-based reconstruction is spatiotemporally continuous fields without missing value over the whole NH, which is a distinct advantage of the PDA-based reconstruction over other proxy-based NH-averaged temperature reconstructions, we focussed on analysing the spatial variations of the NH temperature during the last millennium, for example, the primary modes of temperature variabilities and the spatial variabilities of the NH temperature in three typical climatic epochs of the millennium. Results show that the first-leading mode (explained variance of 72.50\%) of the NH temperature variability is a spatially consistent mode, while the secondleading mode (explained variance of 10.60\%) exhibits a different pattern that is different from the first-leading empirical orthogonal function mode, particularly in the Arctic, which shows a dipole structure anomaly. The 20th century was the warmest, with 94.17\% of the NH displaying positive anomalies. The 11th century was the second warmest century in the record, with 70.26\% of the NH showing a positive anomaly. The 19th century was the coldest, with negative anomalies covering 86.97\% of the NH. Northwest North America and the Northern Europe-Barents Sea are two distinctly anomalous centres during these three centuries. Overall, the reconstructed air temperatures provide a new and reliable dataset for studying the millennial NH temperature variations.},

            Climate field reconstructions (CFRs) of the global annual surface air temperature (SAT) field and associated global area‐weighted mean annual temperature (GMAT) are derived in a collection of pseudoproxy experiments for the past millennium. Pseudoproxies are modeled from temperature (T), precipitation (P), T+P, and VS‐Lite (VSL), a nonlinear and multivariate proxy system model for tree ring widths. Spatial patterns of reconstruction skill and spectral bias for the T+P and VSL‐derived CFRs are similar to those previously shown using temperature‐only pseudoproxies but demonstrate overall degraded skill and spectral bias for SAT reconstruction. Analysis of GMAT spectra nevertheless suggests that the true GMAT frequency spectrum is resolved by those pseudoproxies (T, T+P, and VSL) that contain some temperature information. The results suggest that mixed temperature and moisture‐responding paleoclimate data may produce actual GMAT reconstructions with skill, error, and spectral characteristics like those expected from univariate and linear temperature responders, but spatially resolved CFR results should be analyzed cautiously.

            Reproducible climate reconstructions of the Common Era (1 CE to present) are key to placing industrial-era warming into the context of natural climatic variability. Here we present a community-sourced database of temperature-sensitive proxy records from the PAGES2k initiative. The database gathers 692 records from 648 locations, including all continental regions and major ocean basins. The records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial. Nearly half of the proxy time series are significantly correlated with HadCRUT4.2 surface temperature over the period 1850–2014. Global temperature composites show a remarkable degree of coherence between high- and low-resolution archives, with broadly similar patterns across archive types, terrestrial versus marine locations, and screening criteria. The database is suited to investigations of global and regional temperature variability over the Common Era, and is shared in the Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format, including serializations in Matlab, R and Python.},

	abstract = {Paleoclimate data assimilation has recently emerged as a promising technique to estimate past climate states. Here we test two of the underlying assumptions of paleoclimate data assimilation as applied so far: (1) climate proxies can be modeled as linear, univariate recorders of temperature and (2) structural errors in GCMs can be neglected. To investigate these two points and related uncertainties, we perform a series of synthetic, paleoclimate data assimilation-based reconstructions where ‘‘pseudo’’ proxies are generated with physically based proxy system models (PSMs) for coral d18O, tree ring width, and ice core d18O using two isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation models. For (1), we ﬁnd that linear-univariate models efﬁciently capture the GCM’s climate in ice cores and corals and do not lead to large losses in reconstruction skill. However, this does not hold for tree ring width, especially in regions where the trees’ response is dominated by moisture supply; we quantify how the breakdown of this assumption lowers reconstruction skill for each proxy class. For (2), we ﬁnd that climate model biases can introduce errors that greatly reduce reconstruction skill, with or without perfect proxy system models. We explore possible strategies for mitigating structural modeling errors in GCMs and discuss implications for paleoclimate reanalyses.},

However, such observations only provide indirect (proxy) constraints on physical variables. Proxy system models aim to improve the interpretation of such observations and better quantify their inherent uncertainties. However, existing models are currently scattered in the literature, making their integration difﬁcult. Here, we present a comprehensive modeling framework for proxy systems, named PRYSM. For this initial iteration, we focus on water-isotope based climate proxies in ice cores, corals, tree ring cellulose, and speleothem calcite. We review modeling approaches for each proxy class, and pair them with an isotopeenabled climate simulation to illustrate the new scientiﬁc insights that may be gained from this framework. Applications include parameter sensitivity analysis, the quantiﬁcation of archive-speciﬁc processes on the recorded climate signal, and the quantiﬁcation of how chronological uncertainties affect signal detection, demonstrating the utility of PRYSM for a broad array of climate studies.},

One obstacle that prevents a better understanding of future behavior is a poor knowledge of its past.

            The Asian monsoon system affects more than half of humanity worldwide, yet the dynamical processes that govern its complex spatiotemporal variability are not sufficiently understood to model and predict its behavior, due in part to inadequate long-term climate observations. Here we present the Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA), a seasonally resolved gridded spatial reconstruction of Asian monsoon drought and pluvials over the past millennium, derived from a network of tree-ring chronologies. MADA provides the spatiotemporal details of known historic monsoon failures and reveals the occurrence, severity, and fingerprint of previously unknown monsoon megadroughts and their close linkages to large-scale patterns of tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperatures. MADA thus provides a long-term context for recent monsoon variability that is critically needed for climate modeling, prediction, and attribution.},

            The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) shapes global climate patterns yet its sensitivity to external climate forcing remains uncertain. Modeling studies suggest that ENSO is sensitive to sulfate aerosol forcing associated with explosive volcanism but observational support for this effect remains ambiguous. Here, we used absolutely dated fossil corals from the central tropical Pacific to gauge ENSO’s response to large volcanic eruptions of the last millennium. Superposed epoch analysis reveals a weak tendency for an El Niño–like response in the year after an eruption, but this response is not statistically significant, nor does it appear after the outsized 1257 Samalas eruption. Our results suggest that those models showing a strong ENSO response to volcanic forcing may overestimate the size of the forced response relative to natural ENSO variability.},

	abstract = {Reconstructions of global hydroclimate during the Common Era (CE; the past ∼ 2000 years) are important for providing context for current and future global environmental change. Stable isotope ratios in water are quantitative indicators of hydroclimate on regional to global scales, and these signals are encoded in a wide range of natural geologic archives. Here we present the Iso2k database, a global compilation of previously published datasets from a variety of natural archives that record the stable oxygen (δ18O) or hydrogen (δ2H) isotopic compositions of environmental waters, which reﬂect hydroclimate changes over the CE. The Iso2k database contains 759 isotope records from the terrestrial and marine realms, including glacier and ground ice (210); speleothems (68); corals, sclerosponges, and mollusks (143); wood (81); lake sediments and other terrestrial sediments (e.g., loess) (158); and marine sediments (99). Individual datasets have temporal resolutions ranging from sub-annual to centennial and include chronological data where available. A fundamental feature of the database is its comprehensive metadata, which will assist both experts and nonexperts in the interpretation of each record and in data synthesis. Key metadata ﬁelds have standardized vocabularies to facilitate comparisons across diverse archives and with climate-model-simulated ﬁelds. This is the ﬁrst global-scale collection of water isotope proxy records from multiple types of geological and biological archives. It is suitable for evaluating hydroclimate processes through time and space using large-scale synthesis, model–data intercomparison and (paleo)data assimilation. The Iso2k database is available for download at https://doi.org/10.25921/57j8-vs18 (Konecky and McKay, 2020) and is also accessible via the NOAA/WDS Paleo Data landing page: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/study/29593 (last access: 30 July 2020).},

	abstract = {The response of the hydrological cycle to anthropogenic climate change, especially across the tropical oceans, remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of long instrumental temperature and hydrological records. Massive shallow-water corals are ideally suited to reconstructing past oceanic variability as they are widely distributed across the tropics, rapidly deposit calcium carbonate skeletons that continuously record ambient environmental conditions, and can be sampled at monthly to annual resolution. Climate reconstructions based on corals primarily use the stable oxygen isotope composition (δ18O), which acts as a proxy for sea surface temperature (SST), and the oxygen isotope composition of seawater (δ18Osw), a measure of hydrological variability. Increasingly, coral δ18O time series are paired with time series of strontium-to-calcium ratios (Sr/Ca), a proxy for SST, from the same coral to quantify temperature and δ18Osw variability through time. To increase the utility of such reconstructions, we present the CoralHydro2k database, a compilation of published, peer-reviewed coral Sr/Ca and δ18O records from the Common Era (CE). The database contains 54 paired Sr/Ca–δ18O records and 125 unpaired Sr/Ca or δ18O records, with 88 \% of these records providing data coverage from 1800 CE to the present. A quality-controlled set of metadata with standardized vocabulary and units accompanies each record, informing the use of the database. The CoralHydro2k database tracks large-scale temperature and hydrological variability. As such, it is well-suited for investigations of past climate variability, comparisons with climate model simulations including isotope-enabled models, and application in paleodata-assimilation projects. The CoralHydro2k database is available in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format with serializations in MATLAB, R, and Python and can be downloaded from the NOAA National Center for Environmental Information’s Paleoclimate Data Archive at https://doi.org/10.25921/yp94-v135 (Walter et al., 2022).},

	abstract = {The last quarter century spans the publication of the first assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 and the latest report published in 2013–2014. The five assessment reports appearing over that interval reveal a marked increase in the number of paleoclimate studies addressing the climate of the last 2000 years (the Common Era). An important focus of this work has been on reconstruction of hemispheric and global temperatures. Several early studies in this area generated considerable scientific and public interest, and were followed by high‐profile and sometimes vitriolic debates about the magnitude of temperature changes over all or part of the Common Era and their comparison to 20th‐ and 21st‐century global temperature increases due to increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Behind the more public debates, however, several consistent themes of scientific inquiry have developed to better characterize climate variability and change over the Common Era. These include attempts to collect more climate proxy archives and understand the signals they contain, improve the statistical methods used to estimate past temperature variability from proxies and their associated uncertainties, and to compare reconstructed temperature variability and change with climate model simulations. All of these efforts are driving a new age of research on the climate of the Common Era that is developing more cohesive and collaborative investigations into the dynamics of climate on time scales of decades to centuries, and an understanding of the implications for modeled climate projections of the future.

Constructed from the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag covariability statistics of annually averaged sea surface temperature (SST) and surface (2 m) land temperature global anomalies during 1901–2009, the LIM has hindcast skill for leads of 2–5 yr and 6–9 yr comparable to and sometimes even better than skill of the phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model hindcasts initialized annually over the period 1960–2000 and has skill far better than damped persistence (e.g., a local univariate AR1 process). Over the entire post-1901 record, the LIM skill pattern is similar but has reduced amplitude. Pronounced similarity in geographical variations of skill between LIM and CMIP5 hindcasts suggests similarity in their sources of skill as well, supporting additional evaluation of LIM predictability. For forecast leads above 1–2 yr, LIM skill almost entirely results from three nonorthogonal patterns: one corresponding to the secular trend and two more, each with about 10-yr decorrelation time scales but no trend, that represent most of the predictable portions of the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and Paciﬁc decadal oscillation (PDO) indices, respectively. As found in previous studies, the AMO-related pattern also contributes to multidecadal variations in global mean temperature, and the PDO-related pattern has maximum amplitude in the west Paciﬁc and represents the residual after both interannual and decadal ENSO variability are removed from the PDO time series. These results suggest that current coupled model decadal forecasts may not yet have much skill beyond that captured by multivariate, predictably linear dynamics.},

            Proxy records that document the last 2000 years of climate provide evidence for the wide range of the natural climate variability from inter‐annual to secular timescales not captured by the short window of recent direct observations. Assessing climate models ability to reproduce such natural variations is crucial to understand climate sensitivity and impacts of future climate change. Paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) offers a powerful way to extend the short instrumental period by optimally combining the physics described by General Circulation Climate Models (GCMs) with information from available proxy records while taking into account their uncertainties. Here we present a new PDA approach based on a sequential importance resampling (SIR) Particle filter (PF) that uses Linear Inverse Modeling (LIM) as an emulator of several CMIP‐class GCMs. We examine in a perfect‐model framework the skill of the various LIMs to forecast the dynamics of the surface temperatures and provide spatial field reconstructions over the last millennium in a SIR PF. Our results show that the LIMs allow for skillful ensemble forecasts at 1‐year lead‐time based on GCMs dynamical knowledge with best prediction in the tropics and the North Atlantic. The PDA further provides a set of physically consistent spatial fields allowing robust uncertainty quantification related to climate models biases and proxy spatial sampling. Our results indicate that the LIM yields dynamical memory improving climate variability reconstructions and support the use of the LIM as a GCM‐emulator in real reconstruction to propagate large ensembles of particles at low cost in SIR PF.

            Plain Language Summary
            To detect and attribute anthropogenic climate changes, it is necessary to quantify and understand the wide range of the natural climate variability. The length of the instrumental period is relatively short for investigating slow climate features and their regional impacts. The field of paleoclimate data assimilation offers a way to extend the window of observation and provide physically consistent spatial fields by combining information from both CMIP‐class climate models and proxy records documenting the last 2000 years. These approaches are however confronted with limitations due to the use of expensive global climate models over long periods and the very large number of simulations required to correctly describe the space of possible climate states, which increases exponentially with the dimension of the problem. Here we present a new Proxy Data Assimilation strategy that relies on a statistical model called LIM to reproduce the spatiotemporal dynamics of the surface temperatures simulated by costly CMIP‐class climate models. This climate model emulator is then used to simulate large sets of particles that are optimally combined with the information provided by proxy records to deduce skillful spatial climate fields reconstructions and their low‐frequency variability over the Common Era.

	abstract = {Drought is a complex and multivariate phenomenon influenced by diverse physical and biological processes. Such complexity precludes simplistic explanations of cause and effect, making investigations of climate change and drought a challenging task. Here, we review important recent advances in our understanding of drought dynamics, drawing from studies of paleoclimate, the historical record, and model simulations of the past and future. Paleoclimate studies of drought variability over the last two millennia have progressed considerably through the development of new reconstructions and analyses combining reconstructions with process-based models. This work has generated new evidence for tropical Pacific forcing of megadroughts in Southwest North America, provided additional constraints for interpreting climate change projections in poorly characterized regions like East Africa, and demonstrated the exceptional magnitude of many modern era droughts. Development of high resolution proxy networks has lagged in many regions (e.g., South America, Africa), however, and quantitative comparisons between the paleoclimate record, models, and observations remain challenging. Fingerprints of anthropogenic climate change consistent with long-term warming projections have been identified for droughts in California, the Pacific Northwest, Western North America, and the Mediterranean. In other regions (e.g., Southwest North America, Australia, Africa), however, the degree to which climate change has affected recent droughts is more uncertain. While climate change-forced declines in precipitation have been detected for the Mediterranean, in most regions, the climate change signal has manifested through warmer temperatures that have increased evaporative losses and reduced snowfall and snowpack levels, amplifying deficits in soil moisture and runoff despite uncertain precipitation changes. Over the next century, projections indicate that warming will increase drought risk and severity across much of the subtropics and mid-latitudes in both hemispheres, a consequence of regional precipitation declines and widespread warming. For many regions, however, the magnitude, robustness, and even direction of climate change-forced trends in drought depends on how drought is defined, with often large differences across indicators of precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, and vegetation health. Increasing confidence in climate change projections of drought and the associated impacts will likely depend on resolving uncertainties in processes that are currently poorly constrained (e.g., land-atmosphere interactions, terrestrial vegetation) and improved consideration of the role for human policies and management in ameliorating and adapting to changes in drought risk.},

Since systematic instrumental temperature records only extend back to the nineteenth century, such knowledge mainly relies on climate-sensitive proxy data. Here we critically assess some of the many challenges related to large-scale multiproxy temperature reconstructions. We begin with a review of available large-scale temperature reconstructions, focusing on the diﬀerences in low-frequency variability and the response to natural forcings such as major volcanic eruptions and changes in total solar irradiance. Then, we discuss diﬀerent proxy selection strategies, review previously used reconstruction methods, and discuss their ability to reconstruct the amplitude of the low-frequency variability. To shed additional light on the challenges of large-scale reconstructions, we investigate the spatial and temporal correlation structures in the observed temperature ﬁeld and discuss the implications of these correlation structures regarding the required number and positions of proxies. We demonstrate how the unavoidable uncertainty related to noisy proxies will show up as bias and variance in the reconstruction and that the partition between these forms of errors depends on the reconstruction method. Pseudo-proxy experiments are conducted to further discuss the inﬂuence of noise and the requirements regarding the geographical location and number of proxies necessary for reliably reconstructing the low-frequency variability. We conclude with recommendations for future large-scale temperature reconstructions.},

	abstract = {We commonly refer to state estimation theory in geosciences as data assimilation (DA). This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. DA is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean, and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of DA, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems, and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences, an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of DA being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of DA and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.

Despite progress over the last two decades, however, there remain persistent uncertainties with regard to, inter alia, first millennium temperatures at global and annual scales, the magnitude of multidecadal to millennial-scale changes and their causes, and the surface temperature response to volcanic eruptions. We review the strengths and limitations of existing global and hemispheric paleoclimate temperature reconstructions and highlight likely sources of extant uncertainties, all in the context of the recent Sixth Assessment Report from Working Group I of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Niña-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ensemble.

A substantial portion of pre-industrial (1300–1800 ce) variability at multidecadal timescales is attributed to volcanic aerosol forcing.

	abstract = {Pseudoproxy experiments (PPEs) have become an important framework for evaluating paleoclimate reconstruction methods. Most existing PPE studies assume constant proxy availability through time and uniform proxy quality across the pseudoproxy network. Real multiproxy networks are, however, marked by pronounced disparities in proxy quality, and a steep decline in proxy availability back in time, either of which may have large effects on reconstruction skill. A suite of PPEs constructed from a millennium-length general circulation model (GCM) simulation is thus designed to mimic these various real-world characteristics. The new pseudoproxy network is used to evaluate four climate field reconstruction (CFR) techniques: truncated total least squares embedded within the regularized EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm (RegEM-TTLS), the Mann et al. (2009) implementation of RegEM-TTLS (M09), canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and Gaussian graphical models embedded within RegEM (GraphEM). Each method's risk properties are also assessed via a 100-member noise ensemble.
Contrary to expectation, it is found that reconstruction skill does not vary monotonically with proxy availability, but also is a function of the type and amplitude of climate variability (forced events vs. internal variability). The use of realistic spatiotemporal pseudoproxy characteristics also exposes large inter-method differences. Despite the comparable fidelity in reconstructing the global mean temperature, spatial skill varies considerably between CFR techniques. Both GraphEM and CCA efficiently exploit teleconnections, and produce consistent reconstructions across the ensemble. RegEM-TTLS and M09 appear advantageous for reconstructions on highly noisy data, but are subject to larger stochastic variations across different realizations of pseudoproxy noise. Results collectively highlight the importance of designing realistic pseudoproxy networks and implementing multiple noise realizations of PPEs. The results also under-score the difficulty in finding the proper bias-variance trade-off for jointly optimizing the spatial skill of CFRs and the fidelity of the global mean reconstructions.},

	abstract = {ECHAM6, the sixth generation of the atmospheric general circulation model ECHAM, is described. Major changes with respect to its predecessor affect the representation of shortwave radiative transfer, the height of the model top. Minor changes have been made to model tuning and convective triggering. Several model configurations, differing in horizontal and vertical resolution, are compared. As horizontal resolution is increased beyond T63, the simulated climate improves but changes are incremental; major biases appear to be limited by the parameterization of small-scale physical processes, such as clouds and convection. Higher vertical resolution in the middle atmosphere leads to a systematic reduction in temperature biases in the upper troposphere, and a better representation of the middle atmosphere and its modes of variability. ECHAM6 represents the present climate as well as, or better than, its predecessor. The most marked improvements are evident in the circulation of the extratropics. ECHAM6 continues to have a good representation of tropical variability. A number of biases, however, remain. These include a poor representation of low-level clouds, systematic shifts in major precipitation features, biases in the partitioning of precipitation between land and sea (particularly in the tropics), and midlatitude jets that appear to be insufficiently poleward. The response of ECHAM6 to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases is similar to that of ECHAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the mixed-resolution (T63L95) configuration is between 2.9 and 3.4 K and is somewhat larger for the 47 level model. Cloud feedbacks and adjustments contribute positively to warming from increasing greenhouse gases.},

In this study, a concept of a perfect model, whose solutions are from observations, is introduced, and a dynamical-statistical-analog ensemble forecast (DSAEF) model is developed as an initial-value problem of the perfect model. This new analog-based forecast model consists of the following three steps: (i) construct generalized initial value (GIV), (ii) identify analogs from historical observations, and (iii) produce an ensemble of predictands. The first step includes all appropriate variables, not only at an instant state but also during their temporal evolution, that play an important role in determining the accuracy of each predictand. An application of the DSAEF model is illustrated through the prediction of accumulated rainfall associated with 21 landfalling typhoons occurring over South China during the years of 2012-16. Assuming a reliable forecast of landfalling typhoon track, two different experiments are conducted, in which the GIV is constructed by including (i) typhoon track only; and (ii) both typhoon track and landfall season. Results show overall better performance of the second experiment than the first one in predicting heavy accumulated rainfall in the training sample tests. In addition, the forecast performance of both experiments is comparable to the operational numerical weather prediction models currently used in China, the United States, and Europe. Some limitations and future improvements as well as comparisons with some existing analog ensemble models are also discussed.},

Here, we test the skill of different setups of the AM, in a controlled but realistic situation, by analysing several statistical properties of reconstructed daily high-resolution atmospheric fields for Northern Europe for a 50-yr period. In this application, station observations of sea-level pressure and air temperature are combined with atmospheric fields from a 50-yr high-resolution regional climate simulation. This reconstruction aims at providing homogeneous and physically consistent atmospheric fields with daily resolution suitable to drive high resolution ocean and ecosystem models.
Different settings of the AM are evaluated in this study for the period 1958-2007 to estimate the robustness of the reconstruction and its ability to replicate high and low-frequency variability, realistic probability distributions and extremes of different meteorological variables. It is shown that the AM can realistically reconstruct variables with a strong physical link to daily sea-level pressure on both a daily and monthly scale. However, to reconstruct low-frequency decadal and longer temperature variations, additional monthly mean station temperature as predictor is required. Our results suggest that the AM is a suitable upscaling tool to predict daily fields taken from regional climate simulations based on sparse historical station data.},

The proposed framework produces a reconstruction of the system dynamics in a fully data-driven manner where no explicit knowledge of the dynamical model is required. Instead, a representative catalog of trajectories of the system is assumed to be available. Based on this catalog, the analog data assimilation combines the nonparametric sampling of the dynamics using analog forecasting methods with ensemble-based assimilation techniques. This study explores different analog forecasting strategies and derives both ensemble Kalman and particle filtering versions of the proposed analog data assimilation approach. Numerical experiments are examined for two chaotic dynamical systems: the Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems. The performance of the analog data assimilation is discussed with respect to classical model-driven assimilation. A Matlab toolbox and Python library of the AnDA are provided to help further research building upon the present findings.},

Results showed that DAI can improve the forecast significantly. Especially in lower-dimensional systems, DAI can reduce the forecast RMSE by similar to 50\% compared to the Monte Carlo forecast (MC). This improvement is because DAI is able to recognize the direction of the analysis error through the embedding process and therefore selects those good trajectories with reduced initial error. Meanwhile, a potential improvement of DAI is also proposed, and that is to find the optimal range of embedding time based on the error's growing speed.},

	abstract = {The fourth version of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) was recently completed and released to the climate community. This paper describes developments to all CCSM components, and documents fully coupled preindustrial control runs compared to the previous version, CCSM3. Using the standard atmosphere and land resolution of 1 degrees results in the sea surface temperature biases in the major upwelling regions being comparable to the 1.4 degrees-resolution CCSM3. Two changes to the deep convection scheme in the atmosphere component result in CCSM4 producing El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability with a much more realistic frequency distribution than in CCSM3, although the amplitude is too large compared to observations. These changes also improve the Madden-Julian oscillation and the frequency distribution of tropical precipitation. A new overflow parameterization in the ocean component leads to an improved simulation of the Gulf Stream path and the North Atlantic Ocean meridional overturning circulation. Changes to the CCSM4 land component lead to a much improved annual cycle of water storage, especially in the tropics. The CCSM4 sea ice component uses much more realistic albedos than CCSM3, and for several reasons the Arctic sea ice concentration is improved in CCSM4. An ensemble of twentieth-century simulations produces a good match to the observed September Arctic sea ice extent from 1979 to 2005. The CCSM4 ensemble mean increase in globally averaged surface temperature between 1850 and 2005 is larger than the observed increase by about 0.4 degrees C. This is consistent with the fact that CCSM4 does not include a representation of the indirect effects of aerosols, although other factors may come into play. The CCSM4 still has significant biases, such as the mean precipitation distribution in the tropical Pacific Ocean, too much low cloud in the Arctic, and the latitudinal distributions of shortwave and longwave cloud forcings.},

All three data-assimilation methods provide with good estimations of surface air temperature and of sea ice concentration, with the nudging proposal particle filter obtaining the highest correlations with the pseudo-observations. When reconstructing variables that are not directly linked to the pseudo-observations such as atmospheric circulation and sea surface salinity, the particle filters have equivalent performance and their correlations are smaller than for surface air temperature reconstructions but still satisfactory for many applications.

	abstract = {The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) project is an international effort to produce a comprehensive global atmospheric circulation dataset spanning the twentieth century, assimilating only surface pressure reports and using observed monthly sea-surface temperature and sea-ice distributions as boundary conditions. It is chiefly motivated by a need to provide an observational dataset with quantified uncertainties for validations of climate model simulations of the twentieth century onall time-scales, with emphasis on the statistics of daily weather. It uses an Ensemble Kalman Filter data assimilation method with background 'first guess' fields supplied by an ensemble of forecasts from a global numerical weather prediction model. This directly yields a global analysis every 6 hours as the most likely state of the atmosphere, and also an uncertainty estimate of that analysis.
The 20CR dataset provides the first estimates of global tropospheric variability, and of the dataset's time-varying quality, from 1871 to the present at 6-hourly temporal and 2 degrees spatial resolutions. Intercomparisons with independent radiosonde data indicate that the reanalyses are generally of high quality. The quality in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere throughout the century is similar to that of current three-day operational NWP forecasts. Intercomparisons over the second half-century of these surface-based reanalyses with other reanalyses that also make use of upper-air and satellite data are equally encouraging.
It is anticipated that the 20CR dataset will be a valuable resource to the climate research community for both model validations and diagnostic studies. Some surprising results are already evident. For instance, the long-term trends of indices representing the North Atlantic Oscillation, the tropical Pacific Walker Circulation, and the Pacific-North American pattern are weak or non-existent over the full period of record. The long-term trends of zonally averaged precipitation minus evaporation also differ in character from those in climate model simulations of the twentieth century.

	abstract = {We use the Northern Hemisphere Tree-Ring Network Development (NTREND) tree-ring database to examine the effects of using a small, highly sensitive proxy network for paleotemperature data assimilation over the last millennium. We ﬁrst evaluate our methods using pseudoproxy experiments. These indicate that spatial assimilations using this network are skillful in the extratropical Northern Hemisphere and improve on previous NTREND reconstructions based on point-by-point regression. We also ﬁnd our method is sensitive to climate model biases when the number of sites becomes small. Based on these experiments, we then assimilate the real NTREND network. To quantify model prior uncertainty, we produce 10 separate reconstructions, each assimilating a different climate model. These reconstructions are most dissimilar prior to 1100 CE, when the network becomes sparse, but show greater consistency as the network grows. Temporal variability is also underestimated before 1100 CE. Our assimilation method produces spatial uncertainty estimates, and these identify tree-line North America and eastern Siberia as regions that would most beneﬁt from development of new millennial-length temperature-sensitive tree-ring records. We compare our multimodel mean reconstruction to ﬁve existing paleotemperature products to examine the range of reconstructed responses to radiative forcing. We ﬁnd substantial differences in the spatial patterns and magnitudes of reconstructed responses to volcanic eruptions and in the transition between the Medieval epoch and Little Ice Age. These extant uncertainties call for the development of a paleoclimate reconstruction intercomparison framework for systematically examining the consequences of proxy network composition and reconstruction methodology and for continued expansion of tree-ring proxy networks.},

Data assimilation (DA) methods are a recent and promising new means of deriving CFRs that optimally fuse climate proxies with climate model output. Despite the growing application of DA-based CFRs, little is understood about how much the assimilated proxies change the statistical properties of the climate model data. To address this question, we propose a robust and computationally efficient method, based on functional data depth, to evaluate differences in the distributions of two spatiotemporal processes. We apply our test to study global and regional proxy influence in DA-based CFRs by comparing the background and analysis states, which are treated as two samples of spatiotemporal fields. We find that the analysis states are significantly altered from the climate-model-based background states due to the assimilation of proxies. Moreover, the difference between the analysis and background states increases with the number of proxies, even in regions far beyond proxy collection sites. Our approach allows us to characterize the added value of proxies, indicating where and when the analysis states are distinct from the background states.

	abstract = {The West Antarctic climate has witnessed large changes during the second half of the twentieth century including a strong and widespread continental warming, important regional changes in sea-ice extent and snow accumulation, as well as a major mass loss from the melting of some ice shelves. However, the potential links between those observed changes are still unclear and instrumental data do not allow determination of whether they are part of a long-term evolution or specific to the recent decades. In this study, we analyze the climate variability of the past two centuries in the West Antarctic sector by reconstructing the key atmospheric variables (atmospheric circulation, near-surface air temperature and snow accumulation) as well as the sea-ice extent at the annual timescale using a data assimilation approach. To this end, information from Antarctic ice core records (snow accumulation and 18O ) and tree-ring width records situated in the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere are combined with the physics of climate models using a data assimilation method. This ultimately provides a complete spatial reconstruction over the West Antarctic region. Our reconstruction reproduces well the main characteristics of the observed changes over the instrumental period. We show that the observed sea-ice reduction in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea sector over the satellite era is part of a long-term trend, starting at around 1850 CE, while the sea-ice expansion in the Ross Sea sector has only started around 1950 CE. Furthermore, according to our reconstruction, the Amundsen Sea Low pressure (ASL) displays no significant linear trend in its strength or position over 1850–1950 CE but becomes stronger and shifts eastward afterwards. The year-to-year sea-ice variations in the Ross Sea sector are strongly related to the ASL variability over the past two centuries, including the recent trends. By contrast, the link between ASL and sea-ice in the Bellingshausen-Amundsen Sea sector changes with time, being stronger in recent decades than before. Our reconstruction also suggests that the continental response to the variability of the ASL may not be stationary over time, being significantly affected by modification of the mean atmospheric circulation. Finally, we show that the widespread warming since 1958 CE in West Antarctica is unusual in the context of past 200 years and is explained by both the deeper ASL and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode.},

Reconstructions of summer temperature and precipitation in eight subregions of China over the past 22,000 years show that the CWP summer temperature and precipitation in these subregions are all lower than in the Early to Middle Holocene. The timing of the Holocene temperature and precipitation peaks in northern China (including Northwest China, North China, and Northeast China) is mainly determined by orbital forcing. Greenhouse gas forcing and the land ice-sheet help to fine-tune the timing of the climate maxima. These findings show that the climate since the Last Glacial Maximum in northern China is more sensitive to nonanthropogenic external forcings, whereas the summer precipitation in Southwest China since the early 20th century is controlled more by anthropogenically forced changes.},

Paleoclimate information is sourced from proxy records and climate-model simulations; however, the former are spatially incomplete while the latter are sensitive to model dynamics and boundary conditions. Efforts to combine these sources of information to reconstruct spatial patterns of Greenland climate over glacial–interglacial cycles have been limited by assumptions of ﬁxed spatial patterns and a restricted use of proxy data. We avoid these limitations by using paleoclimate data assimilation to create independent reconstructions of mean-annual temperature and precipitation for the last 20 000 years. Our method uses oxygen isotope ratios of ice and accumulation rates from long ice-core records and extends this information to all locations across Greenland using spatial relationships derived from a transient climate-model simulation. Standard evaluation metrics for this method show that our results capture climate at locations without ice-core records. Our results differ from previous work in the reconstructed spatial pattern of temperature change during abrupt climate transitions; this indicates a need for additional proxy data and additional transient climate-model simulations. We investigate the relationship between precipitation and temperature, ﬁnding that it is frequency dependent and spatially variable, suggesting that thermodynamic scaling methods commonly used in icesheet modeling are overly simplistic. Our results demonstrate that paleoclimate data assimilation is a useful tool for reconstructing the spatial and temporal patterns of past climate on timescales relevant to ice sheets.},

Paleoclimatic data assimilation provides one approach to reconstructing past climate that can account for the diverse nature of proxy records while maintaining the physics-based covariance structures simulated by climate models. Here, we use paleoclimate data assimilation to create a spatially complete reconstruction of temperature over the past 12 000 years using proxy data from the Temperature 12k database and output from transient climate model simulations. Following the last glacial period, the reconstruction shows Holocene temperatures warming to a peak near 6400 years ago followed by a slow cooling toward the present day, supporting a midHolocene which is at least as warm as the preindustrial. Sensitivity tests show that if proxies have an overlooked summer bias, some apparent mid-Holocene warmth could actually represent summer trends rather than annual mean trends. Regardless, the potential effects of proxy seasonal biases are insufﬁcient to align the reconstructed global mean temperature with the warming trends seen in transient model simulations.},

            AUTHOR SUMMARY
            
              The global precipitation EOF1 shows a more complex spatial response than the global temperature EOF1, whereas the initial increase in the associated PC1 significantly lags the initial increase in the global temperature PC1 and exhibits greater millennial-scale structure than seen in the global temperature PC1 (
              Fig. P1
              ). Insofar as precipitation increases should accompany a warming planet, the approximately 2-ky lag between the initial increase in temperature and precipitation may reflect one or more mechanisms that affect low-latitude hydrology, including the impact of Oldest Dryas cooling, a nonlinear response to Northern Hemisphere forcing by insolation and glacial boundary conditions, or interhemispheric latent heat transports. This response may then have been modulated by subsequent millennial-scale changes in the AMOC and its attendant effects on African and Asian monsoon systems and the position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone and North American storm tracks.
            
            
              In contrast, the global temperature PC2 is remarkably similar to a North Atlantic Pa/Th record (
              r
              2
               = 0.86) (
              Fig. P1
              ) that is interpreted as a kinematic proxy for the strength of the AMOC (
              3
              ). Similar millennial-scale variability is identified in several other proxies of intermediate- and deep-ocean circulation, identifying a strong coupling between SSTs and ocean circulation. The large reduction in the AMOC during the Oldest Dryas can be explained as a response to the freshwater forcing associated with the 19-ka meltwater pulse from Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, Heinrich event 1, and routing events along the southern Laurentide Ice Sheet margin, whereas the reduction during the Younger Dryas was likely caused by freshwater routing through the St. Lawrence River and Heinrich event 0. The sustained strength of the AMOC following meltwater pulse 1a supports arguments for a large contribution of this event from Antarctica . With EOF2 accounting for only 13\% of deglacial global climate variability, we conclude that the direct global impact of AMOC variations was small in comparison to other processes operating during the last deglaciation.
            
            
              Our analysis indicates that the superposition of two orthogonal modes explains much of the variability (64–100\%) in regional and global climate during the last deglaciation (
              Fig. P1
              ). The nearly uniform spatial pattern of the global temperature EOF1 and the large magnitude of the temperature principal component 1 (PC1) variance indicate that this mode reflects the global warming of the last deglaciation. Given the large global forcing of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (
              2
              ), the strong correlation between PC1 and the combined GHG forcing (

               = 0.97) (

            We used empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) to provide an objective characterization of the temporal and spatial patterns of the leading modes of global surface climate variability for the 20- to 11-ka interval as derived from 166 published proxy records. In addition to characterizing sea surface temperature (SST) variability, we also characterize variability in regional and global continental temperature and precipitation, as well as derive a composite of global temperature variability.
            
              The low concentrations of atmospheric CO
              2
              during the LGM are thought to have been caused by greater storage of carbon in the deep ocean through stratification of the Southern Ocean (
              1
              ). Release of the sequestered carbon may have occurred due to deep Southern Ocean overturning induced by enhanced wind-driven upwelling and sea-ice retreat associated with times of Antarctic warming, coincident with the Oldest and Younger Dryas cold events in the north.
            
            Several proxies identify large changes in the volume and circulation of the major water masses that fill the deep ocean. During the LGM, there was a marked division in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans separating shallower, nutrient-poor intermediate water from more nutrient-rich deep water. In the North Atlantic, Antarctic Bottom Water expanded northward and upward at the expense of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), while both water masses maintained a vigorous circulation. In the southwest Pacific and the Arabian Sea, there was an increased influence of Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW). During the subsequent deglaciation, there was a net decrease of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) below LGM strength during the Oldest Dryas, renewed production of NADW at the start of the Bølling–Allerød, followed by a subsequent decrease during the Younger Dryas. In the southwest Pacific and the Arabian Sea, the influence of AAIW further increased during the Oldest Dryas, decreased again during the Bølling–Allerød, and subsequently increased during the Younger Dryas. In contrast, intermediate-depth sites in the southeast Pacific suggest greatest expansion of AAIW during the LGM, followed by stepwise reduction between 17 and 11 ka.
            Deciphering the evolution of global climate from the end of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) approximately 19 ka to the early Holocene 11 ka presents an outstanding opportunity for understanding the transient response of Earth’s climate system to external and internal forcings. During this interval of global warming, virtually every component of the climate system underwent large-scale change, sometimes at extraordinary rates, as the world emerged from the grips of the last ice age. This dramatic time of global change was triggered by changes in insolation, with associated changes in ice sheets, greenhouse gas concentrations, and other amplifying feedbacks that produced distinctive regional and global responses. In addition, there were several episodes of large and rapid sea-level rise and abrupt climate change that produced regional climate signals superposed on those associated with global warming. Considerable ice-sheet melting and sea-level rise occurred after 11 ka, but otherwise the world had entered the current interglaciation with near-pre-Industrial greenhouse gas concentrations and relatively stable climates. Here we summarize a major effort by the paleoclimate research community to characterize these changes through the development of well-dated, high-resolution records of the deep and intermediate ocean as well as surface climate.},

It is an extension of the Glacial Atlantic Ocean Mapping (GLAMAP) reconstruction of the Atlantic NSST based on the faunal and ﬂoral assemblage data of the Multiproxy Approach for the Reconstruction of the Glacial Ocean Surface (MARGO) project and several recent estimates of the LGM sea-ice extent. Such a gridded climatology is highly useful for the visualization of the LGM climate, calculation of global and regional NSST averages, and estimation of the equilibrium climate sensitivity, as well as a boundary condition for atmospheric general circulation models. The gridding of the sparse NSST reconstruction was done in an optimal way using the Data-Interpolating Variational Analysis (DIVA) software, which takes into account the uncertainty in the reconstruction and includes the calculation of an error ﬁeld. The resulting Glacial Ocean Map (GLOMAP) conﬁrms the previous ﬁndings by the MARGO project regarding longitudinal and meridional NSST differences that were greater than today in all oceans. Taken at face value, the estimated global and tropical cooling would imply an equilibrium climate sensitivity at the lower end of the currently accepted range. However, because of anticipated changes in the seasonality and thermal structure of the upper ocean during the LGM as well as uneven spatial sampling, the estimated cooling and implied climate sensitivity are likely to be biased towards lower values.},

              Marine and terrestrial proxy records suggest global cooling during the Late Holocene, following the peak warming of the Holocene Thermal Maximum (∼10 to 6 ka) until the rapid warming induced by increasing anthropogenic greenhouses gases. However, the physical mechanism responsible for this global cooling has remained elusive. Here, we show that climate models simulate a robust global annual mean warming in the Holocene, mainly in response to rising CO

Our critical reexamination of this contradiction between the reconstructed cooling and the simulated warming points to potentially significant biases in both the seasonality of the proxy reconstruction and the climate sensitivity of current climate models.},

              An extensive new multi-proxy database of paleo-temperature time series (Temperature 12k) enables a more robust analysis of global mean surface temperature (GMST) and associated uncertainties than was previously available. We applied five different statistical methods to reconstruct the GMST of the past 12,000 years (Holocene). Each method used different approaches to averaging the globally distributed time series and to characterizing various sources of uncertainty, including proxy temperature, chronology and methodological choices. The results were aggregated to generate a multi-method ensemble of plausible GMST and latitudinal-zone temperature reconstructions with a realistic range of uncertainties. The warmest 200-year-long interval took place around 6500 years ago when GMST was 0.7 °C (0.3, 1.8) warmer than the 19

            A comprehensive database of paleoclimate records is needed to place recent warming into the longer-term context of natural climate variability. We present a global compilation of quality-controlled, published, temperature-sensitive proxy records extending back 12,000 years through the Holocene. Data were compiled from 679 sites where time series cover at least 4000 years, are resolved at sub-millennial scale (median spacing of 400 years or finer) and have at least one age control point every 3000 years, with cut-off values slackened in data-sparse regions. The data derive from lake sediment (51\%), marine sediment (31\%), peat (11\%), glacier ice (3\%), and other natural archives. The database contains 1319 records, including 157 from the Southern Hemisphere. The multi-proxy database comprises paleotemperature time series based on ecological assemblages, as well as biophysical and geochemical indicators that reflect mean annual or seasonal temperatures, as encoded in the database. This database can be used to reconstruct the spatiotemporal evolution of Holocene temperature at global to regional scales, and is publicly available in Linked Paleo Data (LiPD) format.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ∼ 21 000 years ago)
has been a major focus for evaluating how well state-of-the-art climate
models simulate climate changes as large as those expected in the future
using paleoclimate reconstructions. A new generation of climate models has
been used to generate LGM simulations as part of the Paleoclimate Modelling
Intercomparison Project (PMIP) contribution to the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project (CMIP). Here, we provide a preliminary analysis and
evaluation of the results of these LGM experiments (PMIP4, most of which are PMIP4-CMIP6) and compare them with the previous generation of simulations
(PMIP3, most of which are PMIP3-CMIP5). We show that the global averages of the
PMIP4 simulations span a larger range in terms of mean annual surface air
temperature and mean annual precipitation compared to the PMIP3-CMIP5
simulations, with some PMIP4 simulations reaching a globally colder and
drier state. However, the multi-model global cooling average is similar for
the PMIP4 and PMIP3 ensembles, while the multi-model PMIP4 mean annual
precipitation average is drier than the PMIP3 one. There are important
differences in both atmospheric and oceanic circulations between the two
sets of experiments, with the northern and southern jet streams being more
poleward and the changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
being less pronounced in the PMIP4-CMIP6 simulations than in the PMIP3-CMIP5
simulations. Changes in simulated precipitation patterns are influenced by
both temperature and circulation changes. Differences in simulated climate
between individual models remain large. Therefore, although there are
differences in the average behaviour across the two ensembles, the new
simulation results are not fundamentally different from the PMIP3-CMIP5
results. Evaluation of large-scale climate features, such as land–sea
contrast and polar amplification, confirms that the models capture these
well and within the uncertainty of the paleoclimate reconstructions.
Nevertheless, regional climate changes are less well simulated: the models
underestimate extratropical cooling, particularly in winter, and
precipitation changes. These results point to the utility of using
paleoclimate simulations to understand the mechanisms of climate change and
evaluate model performance.},

Our reconstruction updates that of Annan and Hargreaves (2013), using the full range of general circulation model (GCM) simulations which contributed to three generations of the PMIP database, three major compilations of gridded sea surface temperature (SST) and surface air temperature (SAT) estimates from proxy data, and an improved methodology based on an ensemble Kalman ﬁlter. Our reconstruction has a global annual mean surface air temperature anomaly of −4.5 ± 0.9 ◦C relative to the pre-industrial climate. This is slightly colder than the previous estimate of Annan and Hargreaves (2013), with an upwards revision on the uncertainty due to different methodological assumptions. It is, however, substantially less cold than the recent reconstruction of Tierney et al. (2020). We show that the main reason for this discrepancy is in the choice of prior. We recommend the use of the multi-model ensemble of opportunity as potentially offering a credible prior, but it is important that the range of models included in the PMIP ensembles represent the main sources of uncertainty as realistically and comprehensively as practicable if they are to be used in this way.},

The model used is a linear inverse model (LIM) derived from the observed simultaneous and 1-yr lag correlation statistics of July–June-averaged SST from the Hadley Centre Global Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (HadISST) dataset for the years 1900–2002. The model accurately reproduces the power spectra of the data, including interannual and interdecadal spectral peaks that are significant relative to univariate red noise.

The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for Gaussian data, an iterative method both for the estimation of mean values and covariance matrices from incomplete datasets and for the imputation of missing values, is taken as the point of departure for the development of a regularized EM algorithm. In contrast to the conventional EM algorithm, the regularized EM algorithm is applicable to sets of climate data, in which the number of variables typically exceeds the sample size. The regularized EM algorithm is based on iterated analyses of linear regressions of variables with missing values on variables with available values, with regression coefﬁcients estimated by ridge regression, a regularized regression method in which a continuous regularization parameter controls the ﬁltering of the noise in the data. The regularization parameter is determined by generalized cross-validation, such as to minimize, approximately, the expected mean-squared error of the imputed values. The regularized EM algorithm can estimate, and exploit for the imputation of missing values, both synchronic and diachronic covariance matrices, which may contain information on spatial covariability, stationary temporal covariability, or cyclostationary temporal covariability. A test of the regularized EM algorithm with simulated surface temperature data demonstrates that the algorithm is applicable to typical sets of climate data and that it leads to more accurate estimates of the missing values than a conventional noniterative imputation technique.},

Based on the Last Millennium (850–2005 CE) ensemble simulations conducted with the Community Earth System Model and by developing a series of pseudoproxy reconstructions for different calibration periods, we ﬁnd that the overall reconstruction skill for global and more regional-scale climate indices depends signiﬁcantly on the magnitude of externally forced global mean temperature variability during the chosen calibration period. This effect strongly reduces the ﬁdelity of reconstructions of decadal to centennial-scale tropical climate variability, associated with the interdecadal Paciﬁc oscillation (IPO) and centennial-scale temperature shifts between the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) and the Little Ice Age (LIA). In contrast, our pseudoproxy-based analysis demonstrates that reconstructions of interannual El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability are more robust and less affected by changes in calibration period.},

Teleconnections strengthen independently of ENSO amplitude; we thus suggest caution in using paleoclimate reconstructions of teleconnection rainfall as a proxy for ENSO amplitude. We demonstrate teleconnection rainfall is sensitive to the pattern of tropical Paciﬁc mean SST changes, underscoring the importance of reducing uncertainties in future warming patterns in the tropical Paciﬁc. Plain Language Summary As we accelerate into a future with higher greenhouse gas concentrations, it is critical to constrain how the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO)—arguably the most inﬂuential driver of weather and climate on Earth—will change. There are still large unknowns surrounding how the tropical Paciﬁc will respond to anthropogenic changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, as well as its associated impacts on rainfall in midlatitude regions such as the United States. Here, we investigate how ENSO and its relationship to rainfall respond to changes in Earth's “average” climate in the past. We explore two key periods during the last millennium in data generated using a new technique called paleoclimate data assimilation. This fuses the information in paleoclimate archives, such as tree rings and corals, with the physics of the atmosphere and ocean represented in global climate models. We examine annually resolved climate “snapshots” and ﬁnd that changes in U.S. rainfall are acutely sensitive to changing tropical Paciﬁc sea surface temperature patterns. These patterns have important similarities with predictions of global warming in 2100. Analogs from time periods in Earth's past with very different mean climate highlight the importance of reducing uncertainties in future warming patterns in the tropical Paciﬁc for rainfall prediction.},

The need to transform the proxy observations into estimates of the climate ﬁeld, and the fact that the observed time series are not uniformly distributed in space, further complicate the analysis. Current leading approaches to this problem are based on estimating the full covariance matrix between the proxy time series and instrumental time series over a ‘‘calibration’’ interval and then using this covariance matrix in the context of a linear regression to predict the missing instrumental values from the proxy observations for years prior to instrumental coverage.},

This method involves specifying simple parametric forms for the spatial covariance and temporal evolution of the climate ﬁeld as well as ‘‘observation equations’’ describing the relationships between the data types and the corresponding true values of the climate ﬁeld. As this Bayesian approach to reconstructing climate ﬁelds is new and different, it is worthwhile to compare it in detail to the more established regularized expectation–maximization (RegEM) algorithm, which is based on an empirical estimate of the joint data covariance matrix and a multivariate regression of the instrumental time series onto the proxy time series. The differing assumptions made by BARCAST and RegEM are detailed, and the impacts of these differences on the analysis are discussed. Key distinctions between BARCAST and RegEM include their treatment of spatial and temporal covariance, the prior information that enters into each analysis, the quantities they seek to impute, the end product of each analysis, the temporal variance of the reconstructed ﬁeld, and the treatment of uncertainty in both the imputed values and functions of these imputations. Differences between BARCAST and RegEM are illustrated by applying the two approaches to various surrogate datasets. If the assumptions inherent to BARCAST are not strongly violated, then in scenarios comparable to practical applications BARCAST results in reconstructions of both the ﬁeld and the spatial mean that are more skillful than those produced by RegEM, as measured by the coefﬁcient of efﬁciency. In addition, the uncertainty intervals produced by BARCAST are narrower than those estimated using RegEM and contain the true values with higher probability.},

Even though AOEnKF is an offline scheme and is therefore computationally economical, it has the ability to capture “flow-dependent” background error covariances that help spread observation information through climate fields. Extensive tests in the Lorenz05 model demonstrate that, compared to the online cycling EnKF (CEnKF), AOEnKF generates smaller posterior errors and requires much less computational cost. Compared to the commonly applied offline EnKF (OEnKF), AOEnKF has the advantages of having a more accurate prior ensemble mean and “flow-dependent” background error covariances, even though the assimilation time scale is beyond significant forecast skill of the climate model. With varying ensemble sizes, sample sizes, observation error covariances and observing networks, AOEnKFs generally produce statistically significant error reduction relative to OEnKF, especially for larger sample sizes, increased observation uncertainties and sparser observing networks. The AOEnKF can be applied based on either the error of state variables from observations (AOEnKF\_E) or the spatial correlation of state variables with observations (AOEnKF\_C), with generally comparable results.},

            Paleoclimate reconstructions are now integral to climate assessments, yet the consequences of using different methodologies and proxy data require rigorous benchmarking. Pseudoproxy experiments (PPEs) provide a tractable and transparent test bed for evaluating climate reconstruction methods and their sensitivity to aspects of real-world proxy networks. Here we develop a dataset that leverages proxy system models (PSMs) for this purpose, which emulates the essential physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes that translate climate signals into proxy records, making these synthetic proxies more relevant to the real world. We apply a suite of PSMs to emulate the widely-used PAGES 2k dataset, including realistic spatiotemporal sampling and error structure. A hierarchical approach allows us to produce many variants of this base dataset, isolating the impact of sampling bias in time and space, representation error, sampling error, and other assumptions. Combining these various experiments produces a rich dataset (“pseudoPAGES2k”) for many applications. As an illustration, we show how to conduct a PPE with this dataset based on emerging climate field reconstruction techniques.},

	abstract = {The particle ﬁlter (PF) and the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) are two promising and popularly adopted types of ensemble-based data assimilation methods for paleoclimate reconstruction. However, no systematic comparison between them has been attempted. We compare these two uncertainty based methods in pseudoproxy experiments where synthetic seasonal mean sea surface temperature observations are assimilated. Their skills are evaluated with regards to local, hemispherically averaged and globally averaged analysis error, and their ability to capture large-scale modes of variability. It is found that the EAKF (Ensemble Adjustment Kalman ﬁlter, a variant of EnKF) performs better than the PF with only one third of the ensemble size, despite PF’s theoretical superiority in allowing for non-Gaussian statistics and nonlinear dynamics. The success of the EAKF is attributed to the facts that (1) Gaussian assumption is somewhat appropriate for this application; (2) The EAKF is less sensitive to sampling errors than the PF due to the different methodological natures. Sixteen members are enough to estimate accurate covariance for the EAKF, but 48 (even 96) members still underrepresent the state space of high-dimensional system for the PF. Our study highlights the importance of a large localization radius in the application of the EnKF to paleoclimate reconstruction due to the sparse proxy network and suggests that additional techniques, such as localization or clustered particle ﬁlter, are needed to improve the PF for paleoclimate reconstruction, in addition to the simple importance resampling currently adopted by most research.},

We then assess the ability of an ensemble Kalman filter to reconstruct the monthly-averaged upper ocean from a noisy set of 24 sea-surface temperature observations designed to mimic existing coral proxy measurements, and compare results for the DL model and LIM. Due to signal damping in the DL model, we implement a novel inflation technique by adding noise from hindcast experiments. Results show that assimilating observations with the DL model yields better reconstructions than the LIM for observation averaging times ranging from one month to one year. The improved reconstruction is due to the enhanced predictive capabilities of the DL model, which map the memory of past observations to future assimilation times.},

Here, a specific self-attention–based neural network model is developed for ENSO predictions based on the much sought-after Transformer model, named 3D-Geoformer, which is used to predict three-dimensional (3D) upper-ocean temperature anomalies and  wind stress anomalies. This purely data-driven and time-space attention-enhanced model achieves surprisingly high correlation skills for Niño 3.4 SST anomaly predictions made 18 months in advance and initiated beginning in boreal spring. Further, sensitivity experiments  demonstrate that the 3D-Geoformer model can depict the evolution of upper-ocean temperature and the coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics following the Bjerknes feedback mechanism during ENSO cycles. Such successful realizations of the self-attention–based model in ENSO predictions indicate its great potential for multidimensional spatiotemporal modeling in geoscience.

	abstract = {It is argued from SST observations for the period 1950-90 that the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean-atmosphere system may be described as a stable linear dynamical system driven by spatially coherent Gaussian white noise. Evidence is presented that the predictable component of SST anomaly growth is associated with the constructive interference of several damped normal modes after an optimal initial structure is set up by the white noise forcing. In particular, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) growth is associated with an interplay of at least three damped normal modes, with periods longer than two years and decay times of 4 to 8 months, rather than the manifestation of a single unstable mode whose growth is arrested by nonlinearities. Interestingly, the relevant modes are; not the three least damped modes of the system. Rather, mode selection, and the establishment of the optimal initial structure from which growth occurs, are controlled by the stochastic forcing. Experiments conducted with an empirical stochastic-dynamical model show that stochastic forcing not only adds energy to the system, but also plays a role in setting up the optimal structure.
It is shown that growth from modal interference can occur for as long as 18 months, which within the confines of this model defines a predictability limit for growth events. Growth associated with the stochastic forcing is also possible, but is unpredictable. The timescale on which the predictable and unpredictable components of SST growth become comparable to each other gives a more conservative predictability limit of 15 months.
The above scenario is based on empirical evidence obtained from SST anomalies alone. From the results of several tests based on statistical properties of linear and nonlinear dynamical systems, one may conclude that much of the ENSO cycle in nature is dominated by stable, forced dynamics.},
