	abstract = {Particle filters are ensemble-based assimilation schemes that, unlike the ensemble Kalman filter, employ a fully nonlinear and non-Gaussian analysis step to compute the probability distribution function (pdf) of a system’s state conditioned on a set of observations. Evidence is provided that the ensemble size required for a successful particle filter scales exponentially with the problem size. For the simple example in which each component of the state vector is independent, Gaussian, and of unit variance and the observations are of each state component separately with independent, Gaussian errors, simulations indicate that the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the state dimension. In this example, the particle filter requires at least 1011 members when applied to a 200-dimensional state. Asymptotic results, following the work of Bengtsson, Bickel, and collaborators, are provided for two cases: one in which each prior state component is independent and identically distributed, and one in which both the prior pdf and the observation errors are Gaussian. The asymptotic theory reveals that, in both cases, the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the variance of the observation log likelihood rather than with the state dimension per se.},

	abstract = {Filter degeneracy is the main obstacle for the implementation of particle filters in nonlinear high‐dimensional models. A new scheme, the implicit equal‐weights particle filter (IEWPF), is introduced, in which samples are drawn implicitly from proposal densities with a different covariance for each particle, such that all particle weights are equal by construction.
            We test and explore the properties of the new scheme using a 1000 dimensional simple linear model and the 1000 dimensional nonlinear Lorenz96 model and compare the performance of the scheme with that of a local ensemble transformed Kalman filter (LETKF). The new scheme is never degenerate and shows good and consistent performance in all experiments. The LETKF has lower root‐mean‐square errors at observed grid points, but its ensemble spread is too low at unobserved grid points, where the IEWPF performs better. Furthermore, the IEWPF has a consistent spread in all experiments.
            This new filter opens up a new class of particle filters that, by construction, do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Climate signals are the results of interactions of multiple timescale media such as the atmosphere and ocean in the coupled earth system. Coupled data assimilation (CDA) pursues balanced and coherent climate analysis and prediction initialization by incorporating observations from multiple media into a coupled model. In practice, an observational time window (OTW) is usually used to collect measured data for an assimilation cycle to increase observational samples that are sequentially assimilated with their original error scales. Given different timescales of characteristic variability in different media, what are the optimal OTWs for the coupled media so that climate signals can be most accurately recovered by CDA? With a simple coupled model that simulates typical scale interactions in the climate system and twin CDA experiments, we address this issue here. Results show that in each coupled medium, an optimal OTW can provide maximal observational information that best fits the characteristic variability of the medium during the data blending process. Maintaining correct scale interactions, the resulting CDA improves the analysis of climate signals greatly. These simple model results provide a guideline for when the real observations are assimilated into a coupled general circulation model for improving climate analysis and prediction initialization by accurately recovering important characteristic variability such as sub-diurnal in the atmosphere and diurnal in the ocean.},

	abstract = {Given a biased coupled model and the atmospheric and oceanic observing system, maintaining a balanced and coherent climate estimation is of critical importance for producing accurate climate analysis and prediction initialization. However, because of limitations of the observing system (e.g., most of the oceanic measurements are only available for the upper ocean), directly evaluating climate estimation with real observations is difﬁcult. With two coupled models that are biased with respect to each other, a biased twin experiment is designed to simulate the problem. To do that, the atmospheric and oceanic observations drawn from one model based on the modern climate observing system are assimilated into the other. The model that produces observations serves as the truth and the degree by which an assimilation recovers the truth steadily and coherently is an assessment of the impact of the data constraint scheme on climate estimation. Given the assimilation model bias of warmer atmosphere and colder ocean, where the atmospheric-only (oceanic only) data constraint produces an overcooling (overwarming) ocean through the atmosphere–ocean interaction, the constraints with both atmospheric and oceanic data create a balanced and coherent ocean estimate as the observational model. Moreover, the consistent atmosphere–ocean constraint produces the most accurate estimate for North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), whereas NADW is too strong (weak) if the system is only constrained by atmospheric (oceanic) data. These twin experiment results provide insights that consistent data constraints of multiple components are very important when a coupled model is combined with the climate observing system for climate estimation and prediction initialization.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new data assimilation approach based on the particle ﬁlter (PF) that has potential for nonlinear/non-Gaussian applications in geoscience. Particle ﬁlters provide a Monte Carlo approximation of a system’s probability density, while making no assumptions regarding the underlying error distribution. The proposed method is similar to the PF in that particles—also referred to as ensemble members—are weighted based on the likelihood of observations in order to approximate posterior probabilities of the system state. The new approach, denoted the local PF, extends the particle weights into vector quantities to reduce the inﬂuence of distant observations on the weight calculations via a localization function. While the number of particles required for standard PFs scales exponentially with the dimension of the system, the local PF provides accurate results using relatively few particles. In sensitivity experiments performed with a 40-variable dynamical system, the local PF requires only ﬁve particles to prevent ﬁlter divergence for both dense and sparse observation networks. Comparisons of the local PF and ensemble Kalman ﬁlters (EnKFs) reveal advantages of the new method in situations resembling geophysical data assimilation applications. In particular, the new ﬁlter demonstrates substantial beneﬁts over EnKFs when observation networks consist of densely spaced measurements that relate nonlinearly to the model state—analogous to remotely sensed data used frequently in weather analyses.},

	abstract = {Reliable estimates of historical and current biogeochemistry are essential for understanding past ecosystem variability and predicting future changes. Efforts to translate improved physical ocean state estimates into improved biogeochemical estimates, however, are hindered by high biogeochemical sensitivity to transient momentum imbalances that arise during physical data assimilation. Most notably, the breakdown of geostrophic constraints on data assimilation in equatorial regions can lead to spurious upwelling, resulting in excessive equatorial productivity and biogeochemical ﬂuxes. This hampers efforts to understand and predict the biogeochemical consequences of El Nin{\textasciitilde}o and La Nin{\textasciitilde}a. We develop a strategy to robustly integrate an ocean biogeochemical model with an ensemble coupled-climate data assimilation system used for seasonal to decadal global climate prediction. Addressing spurious vertical velocities requires two steps. First, we ﬁnd that tightening constraints on atmospheric data assimilation maintains a better equatorial wind stress and pressure gradient balance. This reduces spurious vertical velocities, but those remaining still produce substantial biogeochemical biases. The remainder is addressed by imposing stricter ﬁdelity to model dynamics over data constraints near the equator. We determine an optimal choice of model-data weights that removed spurious biogeochemical signals while beneﬁtting from off-equatorial constraints that still substantially improve equatorial physical ocean simulations. Compared to the unconstrained control run, the optimally constrained model reduces equatorial biogeochemical biases and markedly improves the equatorial subsurface nitrate concentrations and hypoxic area. The pragmatic approach described herein offers a means of advancing earth system prediction in parallel with continued data assimilation advances aimed at fully considering equatorial data constraints.},

	abstract = {This paper studies a new leading averaged coupled covariance (LACC) method for the strongly coupled data assimilation (SCDA). The SCDA not only uses the coupled model to generate the forecast and assimilate observations into multiple model components like the weakly coupled version (WCDA), but also applies a cross update using the coupled covariance between variables from different model components. The cross update could potentially improve the balance and quality of the analysis, but its implementation has remained a great challenge in practice because of different time scales between model components. In a typical extratropical coupled system, the ocean–atmosphere correlation shows a strong asymmetry with the maximum correlation occurring when the atmosphere leads the ocean by about the decorrelation time of the atmosphere. The LACC method utilizes such asymmetric structure by using the leading forecasts and observations of the fast atmospheric variable for cross update, therefore, increasing the coupled correlation and enhancing the signal-tonoise ratio in calculating the coupled covariance. Here it is applied to a simple coupled model with the ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF). With the LACC method, the SCDA reduces the analysis error of the oceanic variable by over 20\% compared to the WCDA and 10\% compared to the SCDA using simultaneous coupled covariance. The advantage of the LACC method is more notable when the system contains larger errors, such as in the cases with smaller ensemble size, bigger time-scale difference, or model biases.},

	abstract = {The tropical bias of double-Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) has been a persistent feature in global climate models. It remains unclear how much of it is attributed to local and remote processes, respectively. Here we assess the extratropical inﬂuence on the tropical bias in a coupled general circulation model dynamically, systematically, and quantitatively using the Regional Coupled Data Assimilation (RCDA) method. RCDA experiments show that the model’s double-ITCZ bias is improved systematically when sea surface temperature, air temperature, and wind are corrected toward real-world data from the extratropics into the tropics progressively. Quantitatively, the tropical asymmetry bias in precipitation and surface temperature is reduced by 40\% due to extratropical impact from outside of {\textasciitilde}25°. Coupled dynamics, as well as atmospheric and oceanic processes, play important roles in this extratropical-to-tropical teleconnection. Energetic analysis of cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport and equatorial net energy input are used to explain the changes in the precipitation bias. Plain Language Summary The tropical bias, especially the simulation of a double-Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), has been a persistent problem for even the most advanced global climate models. This paper shows that the tropical bias in a coupled climate model partly comes from outside the tropics. Our experiments utilize coupled data assimilation to systematically and quantitatively assess the inﬂuence of extratropical climate on the tropical bias. The results show that the extratropical impact on tropical bias is achieved through atmospheric teleconnection, ocean dynamics, and coupled ocean-atmosphere processes. The implications from this manuscript could help diagnose and reduce the tropical bias in climate models, while our method is a showcase for using coupled data assimilation to study climate dynamics in coupled systems.},

The optimal scheme was the fully coupled data assimilation scheme that employs the coupled covariance matrix and assimilates observations in both the atmosphere and ocean. The assimilation of synoptic atmospheric variability that captures the temporal ﬂuctuation of the weather noise was found to be critical for the estimation of not only the atmospheric, but also oceanic states. The synoptic atmosphere observation was especially important in the mid-latitude system, where oceanic variability is driven by weather noise. The assimilation of synoptic atmospheric variability in the coupled model improved the atmospheric variability in the analysis and the subsequent forecasts, reducing error in the surface forcing and, in turn, in the ocean state. Atmospheric observation was able to further improve the oceanic state estimation directly through the coupled covariance between the atmosphere and ocean states. Relative to the mid-latitude system, the tropical system was inﬂuenced more by ocean–atmosphere interaction and, thus, the assimilation of oceanic observation becomes more important for the estimation of the ocean and atmosphere.},

Depending on the nature of associated physics and characteristic variability of the ﬂuid in a coupled system, the response time scales of a model to parameters can be diﬀerent, from hourly to decadal. Unlike state estimation, where the update frequency is usually linked with observational frequency, the update frequency for parameter estimation must be associated with the time scale of the model sensitivity response to the parameter being estimated. Here, with a simple coupled model, the impact of model sensitivity response time scales on coupled model parameter estimation is studied. The model includes characteristic synoptic to decadal scales by coupling a long-term varying deep ocean with a slow-varying upper ocean forced by a chaotic atmosphere. Results show that, using the update frequency determined by the model sensitivity response time scale, both the reliability and quality of parameter estimation can be improved signiﬁcantly, and thus the estimated parameters make the model more consistent with the observation. These simple model results provide a guideline for when real observations are used to optimize the parameters in a coupled general circulation model for improving climate analysis and prediction initialization.},

Because of the instantaneous exchanges of information among the coupled media, coupled data assimilation is expected to produce self-consistent and physically balanced coupled state estimates and optimal initialization for coupled model predictions. It is also expected that applying coupling error covariance between two media into observational adjustments in these media can provide direct observational impacts crossing the media and thereby improve the assimilation quality. However, because of the different time scales of variability in different media, accurately evaluating the error covariance between two variables residing in different media is usually very difﬁcult. Using an ensemble ﬁlter together with a simple coupled model consisting of a Lorenz atmosphere and a pycnocline ocean model, which characterizes the interaction of multiple time-scale media in the climate system, the impact of the accuracy of coupling error covariance on the quality of coupled data assimilation is studied. Results show that it requires a large ensemble size to improve the assimilation quality by applying coupling error covariance in an ensemble coupled data assimilation system, and the poorly estimated coupling error covariance may otherwise degrade the assimilation quality. It is also found that a fast-varying medium has more difﬁculty being improved using observations in slow-varying media by applying coupling error covariance because the linear regression from the observational increment in slow-varying media has difﬁculty representing the high-frequency information of the fast-varying medium.},

	abstract = {Scale-dependent localization (SDL) consists of applying the appropriate (i.e., different) amount of localization to different ranges of background error covariance spatial scales while simultaneously assimilating all of the available observations. The SDL method proposed by Buehner and Shlyaeva for ensemble–variational (EnVar) data assimilation was tested in a 3D-EnVar version of the Canadian operational global data assimilation system. It is shown that a horizontal-scale-dependent horizontal localization leads to implicit vertical-level-dependent, variable-dependent, and location-dependent horizontal localization. The results from data assimilation cycles show that horizontal-scale-dependent horizontal covariance localization is able to improve the forecasts up to day 5 in the Northern Hemisphere extratropical summer period and up to day 7 in the Southern Hemisphere extratropical winter period. In the tropics, use of SDL results in improvements similar to what can be obtained by increasing the uniform amount of spatial localization. An investigation of the dynamical balance in the resulting analysis increments demonstrates that SDL does not further harm the balance between the mass and the rotational wind ﬁelds, as compared to the traditional localization approach. Potential future applications for the SDL method are also discussed.},

	abstract = {An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been implemented at the Canadian Meteorological Centre to provide an ensemble of initial conditions for the medium-range ensemble prediction system. This demonstrates that the EnKF can be used for operational atmospheric data assimilation.
We show how the EnKF relates to the Kalman filter. In particular, to make the ensemble approximation feasible, we have to use a fairly small ensemble with many less members than either the number of model coordinates, or the number of independent observations, or the (unknown) dimension of the dynamical system. To nevertheless obtain good results, we must (i) counter the tendency of the ensemble spread to underestimate the true error, and (ii) localize the ensemble covariances. The localization is severe and leads to imbalance in the initial conditions.
The operational EnKF is used to investigate to what extent our system respects the underlying hypotheses of both the Kalman filter and its ensemble approximation. In particular, we quantify the imbalance in the initial conditions and the magnitude of the model-error component. The occurrence of imbalance constrains the ways in which time interpolation can be performed and in which parametrized model error can be added. With this study we hope to obtain and provide guidance for further improvements to the EnKF.},

	abstract = {An empirical flow-dependent adaptive observation error inflation (AOEI) method is proposed for assimilating all-sky satellite brightness temperatures through observing system simulation experiments with an ensemble Kalman filter. The AOEI method adaptively inflates the observation error when the absolute difference (innovation) between the observed and simulated brightness temperatures is greater than the square root of the combined variance of the uninflated observational error variance and ensembleestimated background error variance. This adaptive method is designed to limit erroneous analysis increments where there are large representativeness errors, as is often the case for cloudy-affected radiances, even if the forecast model and the observation operator (the radiative transfer model) are perfect. The promising performance of this newly proposed AOEI method is demonstrated through observing system simulation experiments assimilating all-sky brightness temperatures from GOES-R (now GOES-16) in comparison with experiments using an alternative empirical observation error inflation method proposed by Geer and Bauer. It is found that both inflation methods perform similarly in the accuracy of the analysis and in the containment of potential representativeness errors; both outperform experiments using a constant observation error without inflation. Besides being easier to implement, the empirical AOEI method proposed here also shows some advantage over the Geer-Bauer method in better updating variables at large scales. Large representative errors are likely to be compounded by unavoidable uncertainties in the forecast system and/or nonlinear observation operator (as for the radiative transfer model), in particular in the areas of moist processes, as will be the case for real-data cloudy radiances, which will be further investigated in future studies.},

	abstract = {Rank histograms are a tool for evaluating ensemble forecasts. They are useful for determining the reliability of ensemble forecasts and for diagnosing errors in its mean and spread. Rank histograms are generated by repeatedly tallying the rank of the verification (usually an observation) relative to values from an ensemble sorted from lowest to highest. However, an uncritical use of the rank histogram can lead to misinterpretations of the qualities of that ensemble. For example, a flat rank histogram, usually taken as a sign of reliability, can still be generated from unreliable ensembles. Similarly, a U-shaped rank histogram, commonly understood as indicating a lack of variability in the ensemble, can also be a sign of conditional bias. It is also shown that flat rank histograms can be generated for some model variables if the variance of the ensemble is correctly specified, yet if covariances between model grid points are improperly specified, rank histograms for combinations of model variables may not be flat. Further, if imperfect observations are used for verification, the observational errors should be accounted for, otherwise the shape of the rank histogram may mislead the user about the characteristics of the ensemble. If a statistical hypothesis test is to be performed to determine whether the differences from uniformity of rank are statistically significant, then samples used to populate the rank histogram must be located far enough away from each other in time and space to be considered independent.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the construction, directly in physical space, of simply parametrized covariance functions for data-assimilation applications. A self-contained, rigorous mathematical summary of relevant topics from correlation theory is provided as a foundation for this construction. Covariance and correlation functions are defined, and common notions of homogeneity and isotropy are clarified. Classical results are stated, and proven where instructive. Included are smoothness properties relevant to multivariate statistical-analysis algorithms where wind/wind and wind/mass correlation models are obtained by differentiating the correlation model of a mass variable. The Convolution Theorem is introduced as the primary tool used to construct classes of covariance and cross-covariance functions on three-dimensional Euclidean space R-3. Among these are classes of compactly supported functions that restrict to covariance and cross-covariance functions on the unit sphere S-2, and that vanish identically on subsets of positive measure on S-2. It is shown that these covariance and cross-covariance functions on S-2, referred to as being space-limited, cannot be obtained using truncated spectral expansions. Compactly supported and space-limited covariance functions determine sparse covariance matrices when evaluated on a grid, thereby easing computational burdens in atmospheric data-analysis algorithms.
Convolution integrals leading to practical examples of compactly supported covariance and cross-covariance functions on R-3 are reduced and evaluated. More specifically, suppose that g(i) and g(j) are radially symmetric functions defined on R-3 such that
g(i) (x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar {\textgreater} d(i) and g(j)(x) = 0 for vertical bar x vertical bar {\textgreater} d(j), 0 {\textless} d(i),d(j)
{\textless}= where vertical bar.vertical bar denotes Euclidean distance in R-3. The parameters d(i) and d(j) are 'cut-off' distances. Closed-form expressions are determined for classes of convolution cross-covariance functions less than or equal to infinity,
C-ij (x, y) := (g(i) *g(j))(x - y), i not equal j,
and convolution covariance functions
C-ii (x, y) := (g(i) * g(i))(x - y),
vanishing for vertical bar x - y vertical bar {\textgreater} d(i) + d(j) and vertical bar x - y vertical bar {\textgreater} 2d(i), respectively. Additional covariance functions on R-3 are constructed using convolutions over the real numbers R, rather than R-3. Families of compactly supported approximants to standard second- and third-order autoregressive functions are constructed as illustrative examples. Compactly supported covariance functions of the form
C(x, y) := C-0(vertical bar x - y vertical bar), x, y is an element of R-3,
where the functions C-0(r) for r is an element of R are 5th-order piecewise rational functions, are also constructed. These functions are used to develop space-limited product covariance functions
B(x, y) C(x, y), x, y is an element of S-2
approximating given covariance functions B(x, y) supported on all of S-2 x S-2.},

	abstract = {The usefulness of a distance-dependent reduction of background error covariance estimates in an ensemble Kalman filter is demonstrated. Covariances are reduced by performing an element-wise multiplication of the background error covariance matrix with a correlation function with local support. This reduces noisiness and results in an improved background error covariance estimate, which generates a reduced-error ensemble of model initial conditions.
The benefits of applying the correlation function can be understood in part from examining the characteristics of simple 2 x 2 covariance matrices generated from random sample vectors with known variances and covariance. These show that noisiness in covariance estimates tends to overwhelm the signal when the ensemble size is small and/or the true covariance between the sample elements is small. Since the true covariance of forecast errors is generally related to the distance between grid points, covariance estimates generally have a higher ratio of noise to signal with increasing distance between grid points. This property is also demonstrated using a two-layer hemispheric primitive equation model and comparing covariance estimates generated by small and large ensembles. Covariances from the large ensemble are assumed to be accurate and are used a reference for measuring errors from covariances estimated from a small ensemble.
The benefits of including distance-dependent reduction of covariance estimates are demonstrated with an ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation scheme. The optimal correlation length scale of the filter function depends on ensemble size; larger correlation lengths are preferable for larger ensembles.
The effects of inflating background error covariance estimates are examined as a way of stabilizing the filter. It was found that more inflation was necessary for smaller ensembles than for larger ensembles.},

It is based on forecasting the error statistics using Monte Carlo methods, a better alternative than solving the traditional and computationally extremely demanding approximate error covariance equation used in the extended Kalman filter. The unbounded error growth found in the extended Kalman filter, which is caused by an overly simplified closure in the error covariance equation, is completely eliminated. Open boundaries can be handled as long as the ocean model is well posed. Well-known numerical instabilities associated with the error covariance equation are avoided because storage and evolution of the error covariance matrix itself are not needed. The results are also better than what is provided by the extended Kalman filter since there is no closure problem and the quality of the forecast error statistics therefore improves. The method should be feasible also for more sophisticated primitive equation models. The computational load for reasonable accuracy is only a fraction of what is required for the extended Kalman filter and is given by the storage of, say, 100 model states for an ensemble size of 100 and thus CPU requirements of the order of the cost of 100 model integrations. The proposed method can therefore be used with realistic nonlinear ocean models on large domains on existing computers, and it is also well suited for parallel computers and clusters of workstations where each processor integrates a few members of the ensemble.},

Traditionally, this has not been done in previous applications of the ensemble Kalman filter and, as will be shown, this has resulted in an updated ensemble with a variance that is too low.
This simple modification of the analysis scheme results in a completely consistent approach if the covariance of the ensemble of model states is interpreted as the prediction error covariance, and there are no further requirements on the ensemble Kalman filter method, except for the use of an ensemble of sufficient size.Thus, there is a unique correspondence between the error statistics from the ensemble Kalman Biter and the standard Kalman filter approach.},

	abstract = {In this study, several approaches for estimating background-error covariances from an ensemble of error realizations are examined, including a new spatial/spectral localization approach. The new approach shares aspects of both the spatial localization and wavelet-diagonal approaches. This approach also enables the use of different spatial localization functions for the covariances associated with each of a set of overlapping horizontal wavenumber bands. The use of such scale-dependent spatial localization (more severe localization for small horizontal scales) is shown to reduce the error in spatial correlation estimates. A comparison of spatial localization, spatial/spectral localization, and wavelet-diagonal approaches shows that the approach resulting in the lowest estimation error depends on the ensemble size. For a relatively large ensemble (48 members), the spatial/spectral localization approach produces the lowest error. When using a much smaller ensemble (12 members), the wavelet-diagonal approach results in the lowest error. Qualitatively, the horizontal correlation functions resulting from spatial/spectral localization appear smoother and less noisy than those from spatial localization, but preserve more of the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the raw sample correlations than the wavelet-diagonal approach. The new spatial/spectral localization approach is compared with spatial localization in a set of 1-month three-dimensional variational data assimilation (3D-Var) experiments using a full set of real atmospheric observations. Preliminary results show that spatial/spectral localization provides a nearly similar forecast quality, and in some regions improved forecast quality, as spatial localization while using an ensemble of half the size (48 vs 96 members).},

The sample covariance can be suboptimal as a result of small ensemble size, model error, model nonlinearity, and other factors. The most common algorithms for dealing with these deﬁciencies are inﬂation and covariance localization. A statistical model of errors in ensemble Kalman ﬁlter sample covariances is described and leads to an algorithm that reduces ensemble ﬁlter root-mean-square error for some applications. This sampling error correction algorithm uses prior information about the distribution of the correlation between an observation and a state variable. Ofﬂine Monte Carlo simulation is used to build a lookup table that contains a correction factor between 0 and 1 depending on the ensemble size and the ensemble sample correlation. Correction factors are applied like a traditional localization for each pair of observations and state variables during an ensemble assimilation. The algorithm is applied to two low-order models and reduces the sensitivity of the ensemble assimilation error to the strength of traditional localization. When tested in perfect model experiments in a larger model, the dynamical core of a general circulation model, the sampling error correction algorithm produces analyses that are closer to the truth and also reduces sensitivity to traditional localization strength.},

Model error, sampling error and fundamental inconsistencies between the ﬁlter assumptions and reality combine to produce assimilations that are suboptimal or suffer from ﬁlter divergence. Several auxiliary algorithms have been developed to help ﬁlters tolerate these errors. For instance, covariance inﬂation combats the tendency of ensembles to have insufﬁcient variance by increasing the variance during the assimilation. The amount of inﬂation is usually determined by trial and error. It is possible, however, to design Bayesian algorithms that determine the inﬂation adaptively. A spatially and temporally varying adaptive inﬂation algorithm is described. A normally distributed inﬂation random variable is associated with each element of the model state vector. Adaptive inﬂation is demonstrated in two low-order model experiments. In the ﬁrst, the dominant error source is small ensemble sampling error. In the second, the model error is dominant. The adaptive inﬂation assimilations have better mean and variance estimates than other inﬂation methods.},

The hypothesis for the cause of the differences between 4DEnVAR and EnKF is the difference in vertical localization, since radiance observations are integral observations in the vertical and 4DEnVAR uses model space localization while the EnKF uses observation space localization. A modulation approach, which generates an expanded ensemble from the raw ensemble and eigenvectors of the localization matrix, has been adopted to implement model space localization in the operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration EnKF. As constructed, the expanded ensemble is a square root of the vertically localized background error covariance matrix, so no explicit vertical localization is necessary during the EnKF update. The size of the expanded ensemble is proportional to the rank of the vertical localization matrix—for a vertical localization scale of 1.5 (3.0) scale heights, 12 (7) eigenvectors explain 96\% of the variance of the localization matrix, so the expanded ensemble is 12 (7) times larger than the raw ensemble. Results from assimilating only radiance observations in the FV3GFS model conﬁrm that EnKF with model-space vertical localization performs better than observation-space localization, and produces results similar to 4DEnVAR. Moreover, a 960-member ensemble is sufﬁcient to turn off the vertical localization entirely and yields signiﬁcant improvements comparing to an 80-member ensemble with model space localization.},

	abstract = {A new multiscale, ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) method, multiscale local gain form ensemble transform Kalman ﬁlter (MLGETKF), is introduced. MLGETKF allows simultaneous update of multiple scales for both the ensemble mean and perturbations through assimilating all observations at once. MLGETKF performs DA in independent local volumes, which lends the algorithm a high degree of computational scalability. The multiscale analysis is enabled through the rapid creation of many pseudoensemble perturbations via a multiscale ensemble modulation procedure. The Kalman gain that is used to update the raw background ensemble mean and perturbations is based on this modulated ensemble, which intrinsically includes multiscale model space localization. Experiments with a noncycled statistical model show that the full background covariance estimated by MLGETKF more accurately resembles the shape of the true covariance than a scale-unaware localization. The mean analysis from the best-performing MLGETKF is statistically signiﬁcantly more accurate than the best-performing scale-unaware LGETKF. The accuracy of the MLGETKF analysis is more sensitive to small-scale band localization radius than large-scale band. MLGETKF is further examined in a cycling DA context with a surface quasigeostrophic model. The root-mean-square potential temperature analysis error of the bestperforming MLGETKF is 17.2\% lower than that of the best-performing LGETKF. MLGETKF reduces analysis errors measured in kinetic energy spectra space by 30\%–80\% relative to LGETKF with the largest improvement at large scales. MLGETKF deterministic and ensemble mean forecasts are more accurate than LGETKF for full and large scales up to 5–6-day lead time and for small scales up to 3–4-day lead time, gaining ;12 h–1 day of predictability.},

	abstract = {Flow-dependent background error covariances estimated from short-term ensemble forecasts suffer from sampling errors due to limited ensemble sizes. Covariance localization is often used to mitigate the sampling errors, especially for high dimensional geophysical applications. Most applied localization methods, empirical or adaptive ones, multiply the Kalman gain or background error covariances by a distance-dependent parameter, which is a simple linear filtering model. Here two localization methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) learning from paired data sets are proposed. The CNN-based localization function (CLF) aims to minimize the sampling error of the estimated Kalman gain, and the CNN-based empirical localization function (CELF) aims to minimize the posterior error of state variables. These two CNN-based localization methods can provide localization functions that are nonlinear, spatially and temporally adaptive, and non-symmetric with respect to displacement, without requiring any prior assumptions for the localization functions. Results using the Lorenz05 model show that CLF and CELF can better capture the structures of the Kalman gain than the best Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization function and the adaptive reference localization method. For both perfect- and imperfect-model experiments, CLF produces smaller errors of the Kalman gain, prior and posterior than the best GC and reference localization, especially for spatially averaged observations. Without model error, CELF has smaller prior and posterior errors than the best GC and reference localization for spatially averaged observations, while with model error, CELF has smaller prior and posterior errors than the best GC and reference localization for single-point observations.},

	abstract = {Localization is essential to effectively assimilate satellite radiances in ensemble Kalman ﬁlters. However, the vertical location and separation from a model grid point variable for a radiance observation are not well deﬁned, which results in complexities when localizing the impact of radiance observations. An adaptive method is proposed to estimate an effective vertical localization independently for each assimilated channel of every satellite platform. It uses sample correlations between ensemble priors of observations and state variables from a cycling data assimilation to estimate the localization function that minimizes the sampling error. The estimated localization functions are approximated by three localization parameters: the localization width, maximum value, and vertical location of the radiance observations. Adaptively estimated localization parameters are used in assimilation experiments with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) model and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF). Results show that using the adaptive localization width and vertical location for radiance observations is more beneﬁcial than also including the maximum localization value. The experiment using the adaptively estimated localization width and vertical location performs better than the default Gaspari and Cohn (GC) experiment, and produces similar errors to the optimal GC experiment. The adaptive localization parameters can be computed during the assimilation procedure, so the computational cost needed to tune the optimal GC localization width is saved. Plain Language Summary Assimilation of satellite radiance observations is essential for numerical weather predictions, especially where conventional observations are limited. Satellite radiances effectively measure integrated quantities over an atmospheric column, but it is not straightforward to d eﬁne the vertical location of such a nonlocal observation. This results in complexities for localizing the impact of radiance observations; however, localization is crucial to effectively assimilate satellite radiances. This study investigated an adaptive localization approach to estimate an effective vertical localization independently for each assimilated channel of every satellite platform. Three localization parameters, including the localization width, maximum value, and vertical location of the radiance observations, were examined. It is demonstrated that using the adaptive localization width and vertical location for radiance observations is more beneﬁcial than also including the maximum localization value. The adaptive localization method performs similarly to the optimal Gaspri and Cohn (GC) function, but the adaptive localization has signiﬁcant computational cost advantages because it does not require intensive tuning of the localization width like the GC localization function.},

Localization is an essential component to effectively assimilate satellite radiances in ensemble Kalman ﬁlters with affordable ensemble sizes. However, localizing the impact of radiance observations is not straightforward, since their location and separation from grid point model variables are not well deﬁned. A global group ﬁlter (GGF) is applied here to provide a theoretical estimate of vertical localization functions for radiance observations being assimilated for global numerical weather prediction. As an extension of the hierarchical ensemble ﬁlter, the GGF uses groups of climatological ensembles to provide an estimated localization function that reduces the erroneous increments due to ensemble correlation sampling error. Results from an idealized simulation with known background error covariances show that the GGF localization function is superior to the optimal Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization function. When the GGF is applied to the AMSU-A radiances, it can provide different localization functions for different channels, which indicates the complexity and large computational cost of tuning the localization scales for radiance observations. The GC, GGF, and ﬁtted GGF (FGGF) localization functions are compared using experiments with the NCEP GFS and the NOAA operational EnKF. Veriﬁcations relative to the conventional observations, AMSU-A radiances, and the ECMWF analyses show that the GGF and FGGF have smaller errors than GC except in the tropics, and the advantages of the GGF and FGGF persist through 120 h forecast lead time.},

	abstract = {The current NCEP operational four-dimensional ensemble-variational data assimilation system uses a control forecast at T1534 resolution coupled with an 80 member ensemble at T574 resolution. Given an increase in computing resources, and assuming the control forecast resolution is ﬁxed, would it be better to increase the ensemble size and keep the ensemble resolution the same, or increase the ensemble resolution and keep the ensemble size the same? To answer this question, experiments are conducted at reduced resolutions. Two sets of experiments are conducted which both use approximately four times more computational resources than the control experiment that uses a control forecast at T670 and an 80 member ensemble at T254. One increases the ensemble size to 320 but keeps the ensemble resolution at T254; and the other increases the ensemble resolution to T670 but retains an 80 ensemble size. When ensemble size increases to 320, turning off the static component of the background-error covariance does not degrade performance. When the data assimilation parameters are tuned for optimal performance, increasing either ensemble size or ensemble resolution can improve the forecast performance. Increasing ensemble resolution is slightly, but signiﬁcantly better than increasing ensemble size for these experiments, particularly when considering errors at smaller scales. Much of the beneﬁt of increasing ensemble resolution comes about by eliminating the need for a deterministic control forecast and running all of the background forecasts at the same resolution. In this ‘‘single-resolution’’ mode, the control forecast is replaced by an ensemble average, which reduces small-scale errors signiﬁcantly.},

	abstract = {The ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) has been widely used in atmosphere, ocean, and land applications. The observing network has been signiﬁcantly developed, and thus, observations with highly dense temporal resolutions have become available. To better extract information from dense temporal observations, one straightforward strategy is to increase the assimilation frequency. However, more frequent assimilation may exacerbate the model imbalance and result in degraded forecasts. To combat the imbalance caused by ensemble‐based data assimilation due to sampling error and covariance localization, three‐ and four‐dimensional incremental analysis update (IAU) were proposed, which gradually introduce the analysis increments into model rather than intermittently updating the state. The trade‐off between the assimilation frequency and imbalance is systematically explored here by using an idealized two‐layer model and the NOAA GFS. Results from the idealized two‐layer model show that increasing assimilation frequency can reduce errors for state variables that are not sensitive to imbalances. For state variable that carries the signal of the external gravity mode and is sensitive to imbalances, increasing assimilation frequency without (with) IAU reduces (increases) errors. Without IAU, more frequent updates result in smaller increments and less insertion noise, while the initialization of IAU cannot effectively mitigate the imbalances with increased assimilation frequency. Results with a low‐resolution version of the NOAA GFS demonstrate that increasing assimilation frequency from 6 to 2 h improves the errors and biases of forecasts veriﬁed with conventional and radiance observations, although gravity wave noise in the forecast is increased. Plain Language Summary Data assimilation combines observations with prior information like model forecasts to produce the best estimate of the state for a dynamical system. For global prediction, a data assimilation interval of 6‐h has typically been used; but for high‐resolution regional models with dense spatial and temporal resolution observations such as radar and satellite data, shorter data assimilation intervals are often used. Given the signiﬁcantly developed observing networks, observations with highly dense temporal resolutions and inhomogeneous spatial distributions have become available. Increasing the assimilation frequency may better extract information from dense temporal observations, but does not give the model enough time to adjust the updated state variables with potentially insertion shocks. This study systematically investigates the trade‐off between the data assimilation frequency and imbalance. Results reveal that increasing assimilation frequency can reduce errors for state variables, because more frequent updates can better ﬁt the model to the observation and result in smaller increments/less imbalances to the model. When the incremental analysis update (IAU) is applied, increasing assimilation frequency reduces errors for state variables that are not sensitive to imbalances, but the opposite for state variables sensitive to imbalances, because the IAU with more frequent assimilation cannot effectively mitigate the imbalances.},

Here, the regression coefficient, or gain, relating ensemble increments for observed quantity y to increments for state variable x is multiplied by a real number α defined as a localization. Localization of the impact of observations on model state variables is required for good performance when applying ensemble data assimilation to large atmospheric and oceanic problems. Localization also improves performance in idealized low-order ensemble assimilation applications. An algorithm that computes localization from the output of an ensemble observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) is described. The algorithm produces localizations for sets of pairs of observations and state variables: for instance, all state variables that are between 300- and 400-km horizontal distance from an observation. The algorithm is applied in a low-order model to produce localizations from the output of an OSSE and the computed localizations are then used in a new OSSE. Results are compared to assimilations using tuned localizations that are approximately Gaussian functions of the distance between an observation and a state variable. In most cases, the empirically computed localizations produce the lowest root-mean-square errors in subsequent OSSEs. Localizations derived from OSSE output can provide guidance for localization in real assimilation experiments. Applying the algorithm in large geophysical applications may help to tune localization for improved ensemble filter performance.},

An empirical localization function (ELF) is used to effectively spread the information from PS in the vertical. The ELF minimizes the root-mean-square difference between the truth and the posterior ensemble mean for state variables. The temporal frequency of the observations is increased from 6 to 3 h, and then 1 h. By observing only PS, the uncertainty throughout the entire depth of the troposphere can be constrained. The analysis error over the entire depth of the troposphere, especially the middle troposphere, is reduced with increased assimilation frequency. The ELF is similar to the vertical localization function used in the Twentieth-Century Reanalysis (20CR); thus, it demonstrates that the current vertical localization in the 20CR is close to the optimal localization function.},

	abstract = {Two techniques for estimating good localization functions for serial ensemble Kalman filters are compared in observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) conducted with the dynamical core of an atmospheric general circulation model. The first technique, the global group filter (GGF), minimizes the root-mean-square (RMS) difference between the estimated regression coefficients using a hierarchical ensemble filter. The second, the empirical localization function (ELF), minimizes the RMS difference between the true values of the state variables and the posterior ensemble mean. Both techniques provide an estimate of the localization function for an observation’s impact on a state variable with few a priori assumptions about the localization function. The ELF localizations can have values larger than 1.0 at small distances, indicating that this technique addresses localization but also can correct the prior ensemble spread in the same way as a variance inflation when needed. OSSEs using ELF localizations generally have smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) than the optimal Gaspari and Cohn (GC) localization function obtained by empirically tuning the GC width. The localization functions estimated by the GGF are broader than those from the ELF, and the OSSEs with the GGF localization generally have larger RMSE than the optimal GC localization function. The GGFs are too broad because of spurious correlation biases that occur in the OSSEs. These errors can be reduced by using a stochastic EnKF with perturbed observations instead of a deterministic EAKF.},

	abstract = {Covariance localization is an essential component of ensemble-based data assimilation systems for large geophysical applications with limited ensemble sizes. For integral observations like the satellite radiances, where the concepts of location or vertical distance are not well defined, vertical localization in observation space is not as straightforward as in model space. The detailed differences between model space and observation space localizations are examined using a real radiance observation. Counterintuitive analysis increments can be obtained with model space localization; the magnitude of the increment can increase and the increment can change sign when the localization scale decreases. This occurs when there are negative background-error covariances and a predominately positive forward operator. Too narrow model space localization can neglect the negative background-error covariances and result in the counterintuitive analysis increments. An idealized 1D model with integral observations and known true error covariance is then used to compare errors resulting from model space and observation space localizations. Although previous studies have suggested that observation space localization is inferior to model space localization for satellite radiances, the results from the 1D model reveal that observation space localization can have advantages over model space localization when there are negative background-error covariances. Differences between model space and observation space localizations disappear as ensemble size, observation error variance, and localization scale increase. Thus, large ensemble sizes and vertical localization length scales may be needed to more effectively assimilate radiance observations.},

	abstract = {Objective data assimilation methods such as variational and ensemble algorithms are attractive from a theoretical standpoint. Empirical nudging approaches are computationally efficient and can get around some amount of model error by using arbitrarily large nudging coefficients. In an attempt to take advantage of the strengths of both methods for analyses, combined nudging-ensemble approaches have been recently proposed. Here the two-scale Lorenz model is used to elucidate how the forecast error from nudging, ensemble, and nudging-ensemble schemes varies with model error. As expected, an ensemble filter and smoother are closest to optimal when model errors are small or absent. Model error is introduced by varying model forcing, coupling between scales, and spatial filtering. Nudging approaches perform relatively better with increased model error; use of poor ensemble covariance estimates when model error is large harms the nudging-ensemble performance. Consequently, nudging-ensemble methods always produce error levels between the objective ensemble filters and empirical nudging, and can never provide analyses or short-range forecasts with lower errors than both. As long as the nudged state and the ensemble-filter state are close enough, the ensemble statistics are useful for the nudging, and fully coupling the ensemble and nudging by centering the ensemble on the nudged state is not necessary. An ensemble smoother produces the overall smallest errors except for with very large model errors. Results are qualitatively independent of tuning parameters such as covariance inflation and localization.},

	abstract = {The analysis produced by the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) may be dynamically inconsistent and contain unbalanced gravity waves that are absent in the real atmosphere. These imbalances can be exacerbated by covariance localization and inflation. One strategy to combat the imbalance in the analyses is the incremental analysis update (IAU), which uses the dynamic model to distribute the analyses increments over a time window. The IAU has been widely used in atmospheric and oceanic applications. However, the analysis increment that is gradually introduced during a model integration is often computed once and assumed to be constant for an assimilation window, which can be seen as a three-dimensional IAU (3DIAU). Thus, the propagation of the analysis increment in the assimilation window is neglected, yet this propagation may be important, especially for moving weather systems. To take into account the propagation of the analysis increment during an assimilation window, a four-dimensional IAU (4DIAU) used with the EnKF is presented. It constructs time-varying analysis increments by applying all observations in an assimilation window to state variables at different times during the assimilation window. It then gradually applies these time-varying analysis increments through the assimilation window. Results from a dry two-layer primitive equation model and the NCEP GFS show that EnKF with 4DIAU (EnKF-4DIAU) and 3DIAU (EnKF-3DIAU) reduce imbalances in the analysis compared to EnKF without initialization (EnKF-RAW). EnKF-4DIAU retains the time-varying information in the analysis increments better than EnKF-3DIAU, and produces better analysis and forecast than either EnKF-RAW or EnKF-3DIAU.},

	abstract = {Hybrid ensemble–variational assimilation methods that combine static and flow-dependent background error covariances have been widely applied for numerical weather predictions. The commonly used hybrid assimilation methods compute the analysis increment using a variational framework and update the ensemble perturbations by an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). To avoid the inconsistencies that result from performing separate variational and EnKF systems, two integrated hybrid EnKFs that update both the ensemble mean and ensemble perturbations by a hybrid background error covariance in the framework of EnKF are proposed here. The integrated hybrid EnKFs approximate the static background error covariance by use of climatological perturbations through augmentation or additive approaches. The integrated hybrid EnKFs are tested in the Lorenz05 model given different magnitudes of model errors. Results show that the static background error covariance can be sufficiently estimated by climatological perturbations with an order of hundreds. The integrated hybrid EnKFs are superior to the traditional hybrid assimilation methods, which demonstrates the benefit to update ensemble perturbations by the hybrid background error covariance. Sensitivity results reveal that the advantages of the integrated hybrid EnKFs over traditional hybrid assimilation methods are maintained with varying ensemble sizes, inflation values, and localization length scales. Significance Statement Data assimilation is critical for providing the best possible initial condition for forecast and improving the numerical weather predictions. The hybrid ensemble–variational data assimilation method has been widely adopted and developed by many operational centers. The hybrid ensemble–variational assimilation method combines the advantages of ensemble and variational methods and minimizes the weaknesses of the two methods, and thus it outperforms the stand-alone variational and ensemble assimilation methods. The hybrid ensemble–variational assimilation method often computes the control analysis using a variational solver with hybrid background error covariances, but generates the ensemble perturbations by an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) system with pure flow-dependent background error covariances. The inconsistencies that result from performing separate variational and EnKF systems can lead to suboptimality in the hybrid ensemble–variational assimilation method. Therefore, integrated hybrid EnKF methods that utilize the framework of an EnKF to update both the ensemble mean and ensemble perturbations by the hybrid background error covariance, are proposed. The integrated hybrid EnKFs use climatological ensemble perturbations to approximate the static background error covariance. The integrated hybrid EnKFs are superior to the traditional hybrid ensemble–variational assimilation methods by producing smaller errors, and the advantages are persistent with varying assimilation parameters.},

	abstract = {All-sky radiance assimilation often has non-Gaussian observation error distributions, which can be exacerbated by high model spatial resolutions due to better resolved nonlinear physical processes. For ensemble Kalman filters, observation ensemble perturbations can be approximated by the linearized observation operator (LinHx) that uses the observation operator Jacobian of ensemble mean rather than the full observation operator (FullHx). The impact of observation operator on infrared radiance data assimilation is examined here by assimilating synthetic radiance observations from channel 1025 of GIIRS with increased model spatial resolutions from 7.5 km to 300 m. A tropical cyclone is used, while the findings are expected to be generally applied. Compared to FullHx, LinHx provides larger magnitudes of correlations and stronger corrections around observation locations, especially when all-sky radiances are assimilated at fine model resolutions. For assimilating clear-sky radiances with increasing model resolutions, LinHx has smaller errors and improved vortex intensity and structure than FullHx. But when all-sky radiances are assimilated, FullHx has advantages over LinHx. Thus, for regimes with more linearity, LinHx provides stronger correlations and imposes more corrections than FullHx; but for regimes with more nonlinearity, LinHx provides detrimental non-Gaussian prior error distributions in observation space, unrealistic correlations, and overestimated corrections, compared to FullHx. Significance Statement Assimilating satellite radiances has been essential for numerical weather prediction. All-sky radiance assimilation can improve the analyses and forecasts of tropical cyclones, but it often has non-Gaussian observation error distributions. With increased model resolutions, nonlinear physical processes can be better resolved, which leads to non-Gaussian error distributions of state variables. Nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity impose great challenges for data assimilation (DA), since most DA theories assume linear processes and Gaussian error distributions. As the spatial resolutions of observations and numerical models will keep increasing, the potential issues of assimilating high-spatial-resolution observations given fine model resolutions need to be examined. The linearized observation forward operator, as an alternative to remedy non-Gaussianity for radiance DA, is investigated. With model resolution increasing from 7.5 km to 300 m, the linearized observation operator has advantages over the full observation operator for assimilating clear-sky radiances, but the opposite is true for assimilating all-sky radiances.},

Traditionally, the localization value applied is spatially homogeneous. Yet there are potentially larger errors and different covariance length scales in precipitation systems, and that may justify the use of different localization functions for precipitating and nonprecipitating regions. Here this is examined using empirical localization functions (ELFs). Using output from an ensemble observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), ELFs provide estimates of horizontal and vertical localization for different observation types in regions with and without precipitation. For temperature and u- and υ-wind observations, the ELFs for precipitating regions are shown to have smaller horizontal localization scales than for nonprecipitating regions. However, the ELFs for precipitating regions generally have larger vertical localization scales than for nonprecipitating regions. The ELFs are smoothed and then applied in three additional OSSEs. Spatially homogeneous ELFs are found to improve performance relative to a commonly used localization function with compact support. When different ELFs are applied in precipitating and nonprecipitating regions, performance is further improved, but varying ELFs by observation type was not found to be as important. Imbalance in initial states caused by use of different localization functions is diagnosed by the domain-averaged surface pressure tendency. Forecasts from analyses with ELFs have smaller surface pressure tendencies than the standard localization, indicating improved initial balance with ELFs.},

The performances of both univariate and multivariate ensemble sensitivities in multiscale flows have not been thoroughly examined, and the demonstration of the latter in realistic applications has been sparse. A high-resolution ensemble forecast of Typhoon Haiyan (2013) is used to examine the performances of the two ensemble sensitivities. Compared to the multivariate sensitivity, the univariate sensitivity overestimates the forecast metric, especially at higher levels. To increase the predicted Haiyan’s intensity, multivariate ensemble sensitivity gives initial perturbations characterized by a warming area around the center of the storm, an increased moisture area around the eyewall, a stronger primary circulation around the radius of maximum wind, and stronger inflow at low levels and stronger outflow at high levels. Perturbed initial condition experiments verify that the predicted response from the multivariate sensitivity is more accurate than that from the univariate sensitivity. Therefore, the ability of multivariate sensitivity to provide more accurate predicted responses than the univariate sensitivity has been demonstrated in a realistic multiscale flow application.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing data play a critical role in improving numerical weather prediction (NWP). However, the physical principles of radiation dictate that data voids frequently exist in physical space (e.g., subcloud area for satellite infrared radiance or no-precipitation region for radar reflectivity). Such data gaps impair the accuracy of initial conditions derived from data assimilation (DA), which has a negative impact on NWP. We use the barotropic vorticity equation to demonstrate the potential of deep learning augmented data assimilation (DDA), which involves reconstructing spatially complete pseudo-observation fields from incomplete observations and using them for DA. By training a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) with a long simulation at a coarse “forecast” resolution (T63), we obtained a deep learning approximation of the “reconstruction operator,” which maps spatially incomplete observations to a model state with full spatial coverage and resolution. The CAE was applied to an incomplete streamfunction observation (∼30\% missing) from a high-resolution benchmark simulation and demonstrated satisfactory reconstruction performance, even when only very sparse (1/16 of T63 grid density) observations were used as input. When only spatially incomplete observations are used, the analysis fields obtained from ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) assimilation exhibit significant error. However, in DDA, when EnSRF takes in the combined data from the incomplete observations and CAE reconstruction, analysis error reduces significantly. Such gains are more pronounced with sparse observation and small ensemble size because the DDA analysis is much less sensitive to observation density and ensemble size than the conventional DA analysis, which is based solely on incomplete observations. Significance Statement Data assimilation plays a critical role in improving the skills of modern numerical weather prediction by establishing accurate initial conditions. However, unobservable regions are common in observation data, particularly those derived from remote sensing. The nonlinear relationship between data from observable regions and the physical state of unobservable regions may impede DA efficiency. As a result, we propose that deep learning be used to improve data assimilation in such cases by reconstructing a spatially complete first guess of the physical state with deep learning and then applying data assimilation to the reconstructed field. Such deep learning augmentation is found effective in improving the accuracy of data assimilation, especially for sparse observation and small ensemble size.},

	abstract = {To ameliorate suboptimality in ensemble data assimilation, methods have been introduced that involve expanding the ensemble size. Such expansions can incorporate model space covariance localization and/or estimates of climatological or model error covariances. Model space covariance localization in the vertical overcomes problematic aspects of ensemble-based satellite data assimilation. In the case of the ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF), the expanded ensemble size associated with vertical covariance localization would also enable the simultaneous update of entire vertical columns of model variables from hyperspectral and multispectral satellite sounders. However, if the original formulation of the ETKF were applied to an expanded ensemble, it would produce an analysis ensemble that was the same size as the expanded forecast ensemble. This article describes a variation on the ETKF called the gain ETKF (GETKF) that takes advantage of covariances from the expanded ensemble, while producing an analysis ensemble that has the required size of the unexpanded forecast ensemble. The approach also yields an inflation factor that depends on the localization length scale that causes the GETKF to perform differently to an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) using the same expanded ensemble. Experimentation described herein shows that the GETKF outperforms a range of alternative ETKF-based solutions to the aforementioned problems. In cycling data assimilation experiments with a newly developed storm-track version of the Lorenz-96 model, the GETKF analysis root-mean-square error (RMSE) matches the EnSRF RMSE at shorter than optimal localization length scales but is superior in that it yields smaller RMSEs for longer localization length scales.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral infrared (IR) satellites can provide high-resolution vertical profiles of the atmospheric state, which significantly contributes to the forecast skill of numerical weather prediction, especially for regions with sparse observations. One challenge in assimilating the hyperspectral radiances is how to effectively extract the observation information, due to the interchannel correlations and correlated observation errors. An adaptive channel selection method is proposed, which is implemented within the data assimilation scheme and selects the radiance observation with the maximum reduction of variance in observation space. Compared to the commonly used channel selection method based on the maximum entropy reduction (ER), the adaptive method can provide flow-dependent and time-varying channel selections. The performance of the adaptive selection method is evaluated by assimilating only the synthetic Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) GIIRS IR radiances in an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), with model resolutions from 7.5 to 1.5 km and then 300 m. For both clear-sky and all-sky conditions, the adaptive method generally produces smaller RMS errors of state variables than the ER-based method given similar amounts of assimilated radiances, especially with fine model resolutions. Moreover, the adaptive method has minimum RMS errors smaller than or approaching those with all channels assimilated. For the intensity of the tropical cyclone, the adaptive method also produces smaller errors of the minimum dry air mass and maximal wind speed at different levels, compared to the ER-based selection method. Significance Statement Assimilating satellite radiances has been essential for numerical weather prediction. Hyperspectral infrared satellites provide high-resolution vertical profiles for the atmospheric state and can further improve the numerical weather prediction. Due to limited computational resources, and correlated observations and associated errors, efficient and effective ways to assimilate the hyperspectral radiances are needed. An adaptive channel selection method that is incorporated with data assimilation is proposed. The adaptive channel selection can effectively extract the information from hyperspectral radiances under both clear- and all-sky conditions, with increased model resolutions from kilometers to subkilometers.},

Furthermore, the largest spread of global ensemble forecasts in the short range on all scales is in the tropics. The presented results suggest that these properties hold even in the perfect-model framework and the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation with a globally homogeneous network of wind and temperature profiles. The reasons for this are discussed by using the modal analysis, which provides information about the scale dependency of analysis and forecast uncertainties and information about the efficiency of data assimilation to reduce the prior uncertainties in the balanced and inertio-gravity dynamics. The scale-dependent representation of variance reduction of the prior ensemble by the data assimilation shows that the peak efficiency of data assimilation is on the synoptic scales in the midlatitudes that are associated with quasigeostrophic dynamics. In contrast, the variance associated with the inertia–gravity modes is less successfully reduced on all scales. A smaller information content of observations on planetary scales with respect to the synoptic scales is discussed in relation to the large-scale tropical uncertainties that current data assimilation methodologies do not address successfully. In addition, it is shown that a smaller reduction of the large-scale uncertainties in the prior state for NWP in the tropics than in the midlatitudes is influenced by the applied radius for the covariance localization.},

	abstract = {Ensemble sensitivities have proven a useful alternative to adjoint sensitivities for large-scale dynamics, but their performance in multiscale ﬂows has not been thoroughly examined. When computing sensitivities, the analysis covariance is usually approximated with the corresponding diagonal matrix, leading to a simple univariate regression problem rather than a more general multivariate regression problem. Sensitivity estimates are affected by sampling error arising from a ﬁnite ensemble and can lead to an overestimated response to an analysis perturbation. When forecasts depend on many details of an analysis, it is reasonable to expect that the diagonal approximation is too severe. Because spurious covariances are more likely when correlations are weak, computing the sensitivity with a multivariate regression that retains the full analysis covariance may increase the need for sampling error mitigation. The purpose of this work is to clarify the effects of the diagonal approximation, and investigate the need for mitigating spurious covariances arising from sampling error. A two-scale model with realistic spatial covariances is the basis for experimentation. For most problems, an efﬁcient matrix inversion is possible by ﬁnding a minimum-norm solution, and employing appropriate matrix factorization. A published hierarchical approach for estimating regression factors for tapering (localizing) covariances is used to measure the effects of sampling error. Compared to univariate regressions in the diagonal approximation, skill in predicting a nonlinear response from the linear sensitivities is superior when localized multivariate sensitivities are used, particularly when fast scales are present, model error is present, and the observing network is sparse.},

This rapidity enables it to quickly assess the ability of a large number of future feasible sequences of observational networks to reduce forecast error variance. The ET KF was used by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction in the Winter Storm Reconnaissance missions of 1999 and 2000 to determine where aircraft should deploy dropwindsondes in order to improve 24–72-h forecasts over the continental United States.

This algorithm can automatically provide an estimate of the localization function and does not require empirical tuning of the localization scale. It can compute an appropriate localization function for any potential observation type and kind of state variable. The empirical localization algorithm is investigated in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5). The empirical localization function (ELF) is computed for the horizontal and vertical separately so that the vertical localization is explored explicitly. The horizontal and vertical ELFs are also computed for different geographic regions. The ELFs varying with region have advantages over the single global ELF in the horizontal and vertical, because different localization functions are more effective in different regions. The ELFs computed from an OSSE can be used as the localization in a subsequent OSSE. After three iterations, the ELFs appear to have converged. When used as localization in an OSSE, the converged ELFs produce a signiﬁcantly smaller RMS error of temperature and zonal and meridional winds than the best Gaspari–Cohn (GC) localization for a dependent veriﬁcation period using the observations from the original OSSE, and a similar RMS error to the best GC for an independent veriﬁcation period. The converged ELFs have a signiﬁcantly smaller RMS error of surface pressure than the best GC for both dependent and independent veriﬁcation periods.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation is an iterative approach to the problem of estimating the state of a dynamical system using both current and past observations of the system together with a model for the system’s time evolution. Rather than solving the problem from scratch each time new observations become available, one uses the model to “forecast” the current state, using a prior state estimate (which incorporates information from past data) as the initial condition, then uses current data to correct the prior forecast to a current state estimate. This Bayesian approach is most effective when the uncertainty in both the observations and in the state estimate, as it evolves over time, are accurately quantiﬁed. In this article, we describe a practical method for data assimilation in large, spatiotemporally chaotic systems. The method is a type of “ensemble Kalman ﬁlter”, in which the state estimate and its approximate uncertainty are represented at any given time by an ensemble of system states. We discuss both the mathematical basis of this approach and its implementation; our primary emphasis is on ease of use and computational speed rather than improving accuracy over previously published approaches to ensemble Kalman ﬁltering. We include some numerical results demonstrating the efﬁciency and accuracy of our implementation for assimilating real atmospheric data with the global forecast model used by the US National Weather Service.},

Both ensemble Kalman ﬁlter methods produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while providing reasonable measures of uncertainty in the assimilated variables. The ensemble methods can assimilate observations with a nonlinear relation to model state variables and can also use observations to estimate the value of imprecisely known model parameters. These ensemble ﬁlter methods are shown to have signiﬁcant advantages over four-dimensional variational assimilation in low-order models and scale easily to much larger applications. Heuristic modiﬁcations to the ﬁltering algorithms allow them to be applied efﬁciently to very large models by sequentially processing observations and computing the impact of each observation on each state variable in an independent calculation.

Traditionally, data assimilation for atmospheric predictability or prediction experiments has attempted to ﬁnd a single ‘‘best’’ estimate of the initial state. Additional information about the initial condition probability distribution is then obtained primarily through heuristic techniques that attempt to generate representative perturbations around the best estimate. However, a classical theory for generating an estimate of the complete probability distribution of an initial state given a set of observations exists. This nonlinear ﬁltering theory can be applied to unify the data assimilation and ensemble generation problem and to produce superior estimates of the probability distribution of the initial state of the atmosphere (or ocean) on regional or global scales. A Monte Carlo implementation of the fully nonlinear ﬁlter has been developed and applied to several low-order models. The method is able to produce assimilations with small ensemble mean errors while also providing random samples of the initial condition probability distribution. The Monte Carlo method can be applied in models that traditionally require the application of initialization techniques without any explicit initialization. Initial application to larger models is promising, but a number of challenges remain before the method can be extended to large realistic forecast models.},

A more general class of methods including these ensemble Kalman ﬁlter methods is derived starting from the nonlinear ﬁltering problem. When working in a joint state–observation space, many features of ensemble ﬁltering algorithms are easier to derive and compare. The ensemble ﬁlter methods derived here make a (local) least squares assumption about the relation between prior distributions of an observation variable and model state variables. In this context, the update procedure applied when a new observation becomes available can be described in two parts. First, an update increment is computed for each prior ensemble estimate of the observation variable by applying a scalar ensemble ﬁlter. Second, a linear regression of the prior ensemble sample of each state variable on the observation variable is performed to compute update increments for each state variable ensemble member from corresponding observation variable increments.

A functional representation for the observation likelihood is combined with the prior PDF to get a continuous analysis (posterior) PDF. Cumulative distribution functions for the prior and analysis are also required. The key innovation is that an analysis ensemble is computed so that the quantile of each ensemble member is the same as its prior quantile. Many choices for the prior PDF family and the likelihood function are described. A choice of normal prior with normal likelihood is equivalent to the ensemble adjustment Kalman ﬁlter. Some other choices for the prior include gamma, inverse gamma, beta, beta prime, lognormal, and exponential distributions. Both prior distributions and likelihoods can be deﬁned over a set of intervals giving additional ﬂexibility that can be used to implement methods like a Huber likelihood for observations with occasional outliers. Priors and likelihoods can also be deﬁned as sums of distributions allowing choices like bivariate normals or kernel ﬁlters. Empirical distributions, for instance piecewise linear approximations to arbitrary PDFs and functions can be used. Another empirical choice leads to the rank histogram ﬁlter. Results here are univariate and can be used to compute increments for observed variables or marginal distributions for any variable for a reanalysis. Linear regression of increments can be used to update state variables in a serial ﬁlter to build a comprehensive data assimilation system.

For instance, a forecast probability of precipitation can have a finite probability of zero precipitation, consistent with a discrete distribution. However, nonzero values are not discrete and are represented by a continuous distribution; the same is true for rainfall rate. Other examples include snow depth, sea ice concentration, amount of a tracer or the source rate of a tracer. Some Earth system model parameters may also have discrete or mixed distributions. Most ensemble data assimilation methods do not explicitly consider the possibility of mixed distributions. The Quantile Conserving Ensemble Filtering Framework (Anderson 2022, 2023) is extended to explicitly deal with discrete or mixed distributions. An example is given using bounded normal rank histogram probability distributions applied to observing system simulation experiments in a low-order tracer advection model. Analyses of tracer concentration and tracer source are shown to be improved when using the extended methods. A key feature of the resulting ensembles is that there can be ensemble members with duplicate values. An extension of the rank histogram diagnostic method to deal with potential duplicates shows that the ensemble distributions from the extended assimilation methods are more consistent with the truth.},

	abstract = {Traditional ensemble Kalman ﬁlter data assimilation methods make implicit assumptions of Gaussianity and linearity that are strongly violated by many important Earth system applications. For instance, bounded quantities like the amount of a tracer and sea ice fractional coverage cannot be accurately represented by a Gaussian that is unbounded by deﬁnition. Nonlinear relations between observations and model state variables abound. Examples include the relation between a remotely sensed radiance and the column of atmospheric temperatures, or the relation between cloud amount and water vapor quantity. Part I of this paper described a very general data assimilation framework for computing observation increments for non-Gaussian prior distributions and likelihoods. These methods can respect bounds and other nonGaussian aspects of observed variables. However, these beneﬁts can be lost when observation increments are used to update state variables using the linear regression that is part of standard ensemble Kalman ﬁlter algorithms. Here, regression of observation increments is performed in a space where variables are transformed by the probit and probability integral transforms, a speciﬁc type of Gaussian anamorphosis. This method can enforce appropriate bounds for all quantities and deal much more effectively with nonlinear relations between observations and state variables. Important enhancements like localization and inﬂation can be performed in the transformed space. Results are provided for idealized bivariate distributions and for cycling assimilation in a low-order dynamical system. Implications for improved data assimilation across Earth system applications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Ensemble Kalman filters are an efficient class of algorithms for large-scale ensemble data assimilation, but their performance is limited by their underlying Gaussian approximation. A twostep framework for ensemble data assimilation allows this approximation to be relaxed: The first step updates the ensemble in observation space, while the second step regresses the observation state update back to the state variables. This paper develops a new quantile-conserving ensemble filter based on kernel-density estimation and quadrature for the scalar first step of the two-step framework. It is shown to perform well in idealized non-Gaussian problems, as well as in an idealized model of assimilating observations of sea-ice concentration.},

	abstract = {A hybrid ensemble Kalman ﬁlter–three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) analysis scheme is demonstrated using a quasigeostrophic model under perfect-model assumptions. Four networks with differing observational densities are tested, including one network with a data void. The hybrid scheme operates by computing a set of parallel data assimilation cycles, with each member of the set receiving unique perturbed observations. The perturbed observations are generated by adding random noise consistent with observation error statistics to the control set of observations. Background error statistics for the data assimilation are estimated from a linear combination of time-invariant 3DVAR covariances and ﬂow-dependent covariances developed from the ensemble of short-range forecasts. The hybrid scheme allows the user to weight the relative contributions of the 3DVAR and ensemble-based background covariances.},

	abstract = {A new approach is presented and evaluated for efficiently applying scale-dependent spatial localisation to ensemble background-error covariances within an ensemble-variational data assimilation system. The approach is primarily motivated by the requirements of future data assimilation systems for global numerical weather prediction that will be capable of resolving the convective scale. Such systems must estimate the global and synoptic scales at least as well as current global systems while also effectively making use of information from frequent and spatially dense observation networks to constrain convective-scale features. Scale-dependent covariance localisation allows a wider range of scales to be efficiently estimated while simultaneously assimilating all available observations. In the context of an idealised numerical experiment, it is shown that using scaledependent localisation produces an improved ensemble-based estimate of spatially varying covariances as compared with standard spatial localisation. When applied to an ensemble of Arctic sea-ice concentration, it is demonstrated that strong spatial gradients in the relative contribution of different spatial scales in the ensemble covariances result in strong spatial variations in the overall amount of spatial localisation. This feature is qualitatively similar to what might be expected when applying an adaptive localisation approach that estimates a spatially varying localisation function from the ensemble itself. When compared with standard spatial localisation, scale-dependent localisation also results in a lower analysis error for sea-ice concentration over all spatial scales.},

	abstract = {A consistent hybrid ensemble ﬁlter (CHEF) for using hybrid forecast error covariance matrices that linearly combine aspects of both climatological and ﬂow-dependent matrices within a nonvariational ensemble data assimilation scheme is described. The CHEF accommodates the ensemble data assimilation enhancements of (i) model space ensemble covariance localization for satellite data assimilation and (ii) Hodyss’s method for improving accuracy using ensemble skewness. Like the local ensemble transform Kalman ﬁlter (LETKF), the CHEF is computationally scalable because it updates local patches of the atmosphere independently of others. Like the sequential ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF), it serially assimilates batches of observations and uses perturbed observations to create ensembles of analyses. It differs from the deterministic (no perturbed observations) ensemble square root ﬁlter (ESRF) and the EnKF in that (i) its analysis correction is unaffected by the order in which observations are assimilated even when localization is required, (ii) it uses accurate high-rank solutions for the posterior error covariance matrix to serially assimilate observations, and (iii) it accommodates high-rank hybrid error covariance models. Experiments were performed to assess the effect on CHEF and ESRF analysis accuracy of these differences. In the case where both the CHEF and the ESRF used tuned localized ensemble covariances for the forecast error covariance model, the CHEF’s advantage over the ESRF increased with observational density. In the case where the CHEF used a hybrid error covariance model but the ESRF did not, the CHEF had a substantial advantage for all observational densities.},

	abstract = {Part 1’s localization method, Ensemble COrrelations Raised to A Power (ECO-RAP), is incorporated into a Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF). Because brute force incorporation would be too expensive, we demonstrate a factorization property for Part 1’s Covariances Adaptively Localized with ECO-rap (CALECO) forecast error covariance matrix that, together with other simpliﬁcations, reduces the cost. The property inexpensively provides a large CALECO ensemble whose covariance is the CALECO matrix. Each member of the CALECO ensemble is an element-wise product between one raw ensemble member and one column of the square root of the ECO-RAP matrix. The LETKF is applied to the CALECO ensemble rather than the raw ensemble. The approach enables the update of large numbers of variables within each observation volume at little additional computational cost. Under plausible assumptions, this makes the CALECO and standard LETKF costs similar. The CALECO LETKF does not require artiﬁcial observation error inﬂation or vertically conﬁned observation volumes both of which confound the assimilation of non-local observations such as satellite observations. Using a 27 member ensemble from a global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) system, we depict four-dimensional (4-D) ﬂow-adaptive error covariance localization and test the ability of the CALECO LETKF to reduce analysis error.},

This study proposes an efficient and embarrassingly parallel method to generate additional ensemble members: the Probit-space Ensemble Size Expansion for Gaussian Copulas (PESE-GC; “peace gee see”). Such members are called “virtual members”. PESE-GC utilizes the users' knowledge of the marginal distributions of forecast model variables. Virtual members can be generated from any (potentially non-Gaussian) multivariate forecast distribution that has a Gaussian copula. PESE-GC's impact on EnsDA is evaluated using the 40-variable Lorenz 1996 model, several EnsDA algorithms, several observation operators, a range of EnsDA cycling intervals, and a range of forecast ensemble sizes. Significant improvements to EnsDA ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{p}\&lt;0.01{\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are observed when either (1) the forecast ensemble size is small ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}≤20{\textless}/span{\textgreater} members), (2) the user selects marginal distributions that improve the forecast model variable statistics, and/or (3) the rank histogram filter is used with non-parametric priors in high-forecast-spread situations.
